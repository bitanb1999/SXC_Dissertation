This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",1567525791.0
1,Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is ever allowed here. No matter what day it is.,713,pl9suy,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pl9suy/please_remember_that_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/,43,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",1631232110.0

5,"Despite my best efforts to the contrary, I survived and things are actually going well",33,129vvix,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/129vvix/despite_my_best_efforts_to_the_contrary_i/,5,"For context, I have had treatment resistant depression and suicidal ideation for about seven years. I had tried at least one antidepressant from every class and, have had multiple psychiatrist and therapist tell me that they don't know what else to try. The only time that I haven't had depression before this attempt was a one week period about three years ago, and another one week period about a month later. So I figured I was a lost cause, and spent years planing how to end my life. I had a plan that I figured was good enough, and started to enact it. I don't know how much detail I am allowed to give so I'll keep it vague. I decided to combine an OD of a medication that I was prescribed with  a second method. After about 45 minutes I hadn't thrown up, my speech was becoming slurred, and I was losing motor coordination. I didn't want my family to wonder what happened to me, so I called 911 to let them know how I was going to die and where. Because of how much of an effect the medication was having on me, I thought I was a goner for sure so I agreed to not fallow through with the second method. Long story short, one of the sheriff deputies was an ass because I interrupted his time he spends playing games on his phone at the end of his shift, and by the time the ambulance came, I could barley walk on a flat surface, and could not walk up stares at all. By this time it had been about an hour since I had taken the medication and I could barley speak, walk, think, or remember things like my social, or my phone number. The ambulance staff were nice enough, and given how much of an effect the medication was having on me, and how much time it had been, I figured they couldn't pump my stomach or anything so I agreed to tell them the medication I had taken, except that by this point I could not pronounce the name of it. Basically I told him what it was for, what it did, and he googled medications and had me say yes or no. Eventually he found it and took me to the ER. At the ER, it sounded like the doctor was basically like, all we can do is try to keep my blood pressure from falling even more but it was too late to do anything else. And in the interest of complete transparency, when I became nauseous, and vomited what looked like some of the partially digested medication, I was disappointed,  and hoped enough had reached my blood stream that I would not survive. When they took me to a room and asked if I could walk from a stretcher to the hospital bed, I found out that I could barley move myself from laying down and I was no longer able to even walk. When the hospital staff asked me basic questions, I could hardly remember anything, and ended up giving them a lot of wrong information. They gave me a three bags of saline solution trying to get my blood pressure back to a safe range. They were able to get my blood pressure back to a safe enough range but my heart was still week. After about six hours they decided that it was safe to send me to the inpatient unit. And when I met the doctor he said that I had come close to dying.

TLDR, I made an attempt, and according to the doctor I almost died.

Since then, as long as I take the antidepressant they started me on in the hospital I no longer have suicidal ideation, I'm actually functional, I have a good paying job, and for the first time in what feels like forever, I'm largely content with my life. That's saying a lot coming from someone that had basically nonstop suicidal ideation for the past seven years, and was borderline comatose from depression for the last three years. This is a statement that I honestly thought I would never be able to make just a month ago. I have been out of the hospital for about a month now and so far so good. So the moral of my true story is, even if you have been suicidal for years, have tried a whole bunch of medications, treatments, providers, extra, that doesn't mean that you are a lost cause. And this is coming from someone that, at the time, was honestly disappointed that I had survived my suicide attempt. The depression lies. I know it might make you feel like you are seeing the truth that others are unable to see, but it's not. Depression lies.",1680464800.0

I hope if my suicide gets shared online, it at least stops some people from thinking about doing it, suicide videos that I watched did stop me a while from committing suicide, but it's still not enough for me.

I feel disgusting inside and out and I'm sure if confessed to every single bad thing I've done and felt guilty for, making me want to take my own life, you would want me to commit suicide and die a very long and painful death too. You would encourage it",1680426620.0

I feel like nothing is going to change this. It is just the same old stuff everyday. I am tired and want a break but it’s not that easy. 

Also, the economy is in the fucking drain and I feel like I make decent money but we are barely making it.

I want death, I long for it. Why is it so wrong when it will make me happy. It will take me out of this misery that is my life. My mom always tells me that she needs me, that she would be lost without me. But what about me? What about what I want? My family keeps seeing me pedophile cousin despite him abusing me. But what about me? Do they not realize how much they seeing him destroys me? My aunt lives in my basement because she's a drug addict and can't hold down a job. But what about me? She brought the man who abused me when I was 4 into my life. He destroyed my life and everytime I see her, all I see is him. She is also the mother of my cousin who abused me and tried to convince me it was a hallucination. (I'm bipolar and deal used to hallucinate a lot). Why can't they just let me go. Why can't they see that I would be so much happier if I were dead. If they really loved me, they would accept it. But they don't. They don't care. And I can't kill myself because they need me. I hate my life. I'm miserable and all I want is to die. I just tell myself that it will be soon. It will happen. I won't have to be alive for much longer. I have a rope in my closet, a blade in a box on my desk. I have options, I have methods. I just have to wait a little longer. I can't stay strong for much longer and I don't think I should have to.

Hello 
I hate everything about myself. I’m ugly, short, skinny, stupid, and I have a small penis. I have problems from my childhood: I cannot express my emotions well, I have irrational fears, and anxiety problems. My dad wasn’t present, my brother is mentally challenged, and my mother used to scream curse words at me, saying she was going to cut her head off. But, the worst part for me is that I have a cuckold fetish. Anything I do, I can’t fucking escape. I wanted to become a physicist; I studied for hours when I was younger, but my mother killed my enjoyment. I wanted to be good at video games, but I learned that I have tremors in my wrist and arm. In these past few years, I wanted to try to improve myself. I started working out consistently, I tried learning how to talk to people, and made online friends. I tried to stop watching porn. But as with anything, I’m just given another reason to fucking quit, because I learned about my disgusting fetish. I don’t really see a way out. How am I supposed to have fun when I can’t escape my anxiety, my fear, my lust? Every single day, I am reminded of why I want to kill myself. It’s not just the insults towards ugly, or short, or stupid people, but the fact that I wake up, I talk to my friends, and think of something absolutely gut-wrenching about them, related to my fetish. I just want to be a normal person. To be good at fucking video games. To talk with a friend without thinking of something fucking disgusting. But I can’t.

It almost feels like I'm the protagonist from The Stranger (Albert Camus). 
The last year has been a bit unexpected and I don't know how to cope with it or how to deal with it. I keep having intrusive or disturbing thoughts. I really need therapy to figure out how to avoid them but I can't afford it. No matter what I'm doing, there's this existential dread in the back of my mind. I look at people and I keep wondering how they're going to die one day. My parents are a bit toxic and sometimes I hate them but I immediately think about all the reasons they are acting that way and I keep it all to myself. I've always been scared of death and I have never mentioned it to anyone, most people around me are extremely religious.
Since last year, I've had multiple thoughts of ending it all because it feels like I have so much going on in my mind that I'm confused about and I have no one around me that I can talk about. There aren't many sharp objects in my house due to my parents' anger issues which is probably the biggest reason why I haven't ended myself. It feels like I'm living my life as a grey rock and it was okay when I was a child but I can't do it any longer. At this point, feeling any emotion ultimately makes me sad about everything. Even pleasuring myself makes me cry sometimes because I know what's going to come after it, that same sad feeling. I daydream about my alternate lives and it was an escape mechanism since I've been a kid but now even that doesn't make me feel better because now I'm aware why I do it. 
I don't know if I've made much sense. I don't even know if this counts as being suicidal. I know I'm not suicidal right now and I know I most probably will never act on it. I just feel like I'm stuck in a toxic home and that combined with my existential dread makes me constantly overwhelmed by whatever this feeling is but I can't express myself and I can't move out and I have no motivation to study hard and find a job.

Every day just gets worst, my gf ""cheated"", my grades have been going down, i don't have real Friends (plus we are always in awkards situations), I'm a nobody,  my parents are all the time making me suffer mentally, plus i hate myself (im just a piece of sht who doesn't deserve anything).
With all of this i started to do self h*rm. The only thing that really calmed me down, after a breakdown i told my parents so they could help me with all of this and they just told me not to do it and 2 days later everything is still the same (i could have klld myself) i didnt do it because of them and after having the guts to tell them about everything they just told me not to and proceded to still treat me like sht, only caring about my studies (i just failed one).
So i thought that perhaps my friends would help me. We were all sitting on a bench, talking about our problems (i didnt mencion any of the sh or suicide), we all opened about everything plus i even cried and just 2 days later everything is back to normal. I get ignored every time, i get treated like an autist. 
I swear its just my grandparents what are holding me back. Because although i tried to make myself a better life with new Friends. I cant...

Gosh i feel such like a crybaby. I've never been able to express anything since i feel like a selfish person plus no one cares.

It's like I want to die but the sadness my mom would go through makes me rethink a lot, but then at the same time I don't care about how she would feel because of how she made me feel.

When I was 8 I was doing a lot of swimming because I wanted to be ""skinny"", once I finished all the classes I was asked if I wanted to start competitive swimming, I remember standing in the mirror of the bathroom looking at my stomach and thighs. I ended up agreeing to do competitive swimming, but even now my mom and grandma still call me ""fat"". It's still in my head its like I hear all the insults not of just being fat but dumb too whenever it's silent. When I was 11, I fainted at least 2 times in public from not eating, when my close friend forced me to tell her what was going on the next day she was out loud making it very obvious that she was calorie counting, I was sitting right next to her. My Mom was also very strict about school so all my grades have always been A+ I don't even try anymore but I do at the same time.  It's hard to explain. Around I picked up a couple of ways to ""cope"" so I started to sh. That way of coping turned into a habit.

Hello peeps,

I  tried for a long time to hold off, thinking and hoping things will be  get better. I listened to many, who will tell me how previous life is,  and how there is always something to live for, to not ""do anything  stupid"".

Living seemingly for others when really others don't care. the life of loneliness that never ever will go away.

I  lost everything that was ever important, I was never able to make  things work although my heart was in the right place. I tried, I truly  did. I fail at everything, and I have no further need for hoping. I  mean, why?  There's no point. I am in my mid 50's. Things don't get  better. I am a true loser, I'm ugly as hell, no love in my life.

I'm  not a druggie, just a regular guy, but I was not fortunate to be able  to get good things, things to live for. Every effort is just failure,  and at this age and point, there just isn't a need anymore.

For  the past 5 days, I have overdosed on my blood pressure medication and  insulin. I have taken 15-20 pills of losartan, and also taken 100 units  of my insulin. Yet all that happens is me waking up fatigued.

Listen,   I want to die.  I'm no longer trying to find reasons to live. I don't  want it. I can't seem to even get suicide attempts right. Already I am  eyeing the door that maybe I can use for hanging.

It  has to be done.  I don't want to end my day in constant mental pain and  relive having nothing to live for, nothing to wake up to.

If  people think that suicide is a cowardice, or selfish, then I guess it  is.  Hearing something like that might be more encouraging to do it.

This is what I want. I hope I don't fail at this.",1680480038.0

I’m not good enough for one, so that’s probably for the best, I bring nothing to the table. I hate my body, I hate how I look, and I’m always attracted to people who are above me. I’m always awkward. I have no reason to be confident, I’m just barely floating on thin air. I’m fickle, flighty, and distant even though I want so much to be close with someone.

I’m nothing overall. Never been to college even though I’d like to, since I don’t have the work ethic, and I’d rather die than toil the rest of my life in the trades. I have no career. I try writing, I try making music, I try practicing but I never get better, nothing lives up to how I imagine it. I’m trapped forever, I’m stuck forever and it’s torture. My life is nothing. And this world is evil. Capitalism is soul-crushing, climate change will kill us all, and between fascism, declining living standards, war, whatever, there’s not really much of a future to look forward to. 

I have no past to look backward to, and I can’t unlock the present moment, because I’m being pulled in every direction. That’s what really bites. I feel everything, I want to see and do everything, I want to express myself, I want to live, but executive dysfunction makes sure that I can’t do anything about any of that. It feels like I could fall apart at any moment. 

I think about suicide most days. I have no insurance, therapy isn’t an option, and most behavioural therapies are superficial anyway. Nothing can fix the absence of something more, nothing can help that I was hampered from birth, that my ability to do anything at all is choked. I am my sickness, there’s nothing outside of it, no way out, because it’s etched into my body and soul. 

Sometimes I think I should just move out to a cave and be some reclusive ascetic, where I won’t bother anyone, where I can slowly lose my sense of self and just be no one, since I can’t seem to be someone much at all. 

I’m so far behind everyone my age, and I’ll never catch up with them. Maybe I’m not supposed to compare myself to others, but that doesn’t change how ostracising it is. It doesn’t matter, because everyone else already compares you with others, and if you want to be part of it all, you have to keep up, but I can’t keep up. I’m always in the dark, off the mark, and sputtering sideways.

What difference does it make? I ask my self, but no one ever answers. I suppose there are no answers, it’s all too much to ask, it’s all well out of hand. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just want someone to tell me otherwise, to show me how wrong I am and that things are gonna start looking up, but they don't seem to.

Sorry for that rambling word salad, I’m not even sure what this was all for anyhow. I’m not even sure this goes here, but I don’t know where to post this really.",1680469958.0

The truth is, there’s no bigger picture. I go to school to get qualifications in some subjects, so I can study them in-depth at university. I go to university to get qualified for a job. 

I get a job to earn money, I earn money mostly to pay bills and to buy things I enjoy. I workout to look good and be attractive. 

I try and balance my school life with a social life and a private life. But why?

What am I working towards? A dysfunctional relationship (or several)? being hyperstressed over my 50+ hour workweek? Kids?! 

The things I want, I cannot have. I’m unspecial and mediocre, I don’t have enough money to travel and live opulently.

So why am I alive? I’ll tell you why. Because if I killed myself, I would upset a lot of people.

Having been born with at least some semblance of human empathy I don’t want to imagine doing that. 

So there we have it. The point in our lives is that if some of us kill ourselves, we’ll just upset the others. 

You may think no one cares about you, and sometimes it may feel like that because of the way you are treated. But, perhaps unfortunately, people do care. I care.

I genuinely wonder if I’ll ever be able to have a healthy relationship (specifically because of the BPD). When I make strong decisions that I believe are good and healthy boundaries for myself….I then can never tell if I am correct or not after the fact. Then I am just confused, I feel like I am being gaslit by my own brain. I just can’t keep feeling not loved. 

My long term relationship (we also live together), is currently at a crossroads. Now I am sitting here wondering if I just made up all this stuff that I thought I had FINALLY had space to communicate to my partner about….I-… I feel SUCH A DEEP AMOUNT OF AGONIZING PAIN AND CONFUSION!! It feels like my brain is sabotaging ME AND MY RELATIONSHIP. I don’t know which side is up. I feel like I am drowning. I have such a hard time feeling love.

I just hurt so bad ALL THE TIME. My emotional pain is often so large that it manifests itself IN PHYSICAL PAIN TOO. I’ve had seizure like episodes in relation to my mental health. It is ripping me apart from the inside. I feel like I am have a Large McDouble “Combo Mental Illnesses Episode”, happening right now. I want to just put my thoughts in a blender and put it on pulse a few times. I have so much rage and fury and anger inside of me. Bc I am tired of not feeling loved and I cannot tell if it’s ME or my partner. (Among a few other large issues)

I have half my clothes packed. But I have no where that’s in the state that I can go, if I decide to leave. If I did, I would have to go half way cross country to stay (closest & safest) and I do not have a whole lot of extra cash for gas. (Currently unemployed bc I took FMLA, then afterwards I needed ADA accommodations and they denied them.)
Also, I am making car payments still and I would not have the right to work in another state and I have medicine, doctors appointments, therapy that I all need very badly that I wouldn’t have access to ALL THAT if I decided to leave now for another state. 

Genuinely, during the conversations my partner and I have had during this crossroads I’ve managed to keep myself feeling non-suicidal, until I started packing my stuff and it just broke me even more than I was before. Unsavory thoughts are already a pretty constant battle in my day to day life. So now I just keep splitting into every emotion, including feeling numb and suicidal, because of the BPD.",1680473253.0

This is the first sense of joy, not to be confused for momentary sensory happiness, that I have achieved in 10 years. My ending brings be so much pleasure.

There has not been a moment in the past 15 years where I have achieved any sort of growth of fulfillment is my life. A person can reach a point in life due to an array of self destructive behaviors where there is so much regret, despair, and distain that nothing seems worth it anymore. Even further, there is no emotive reaction to anything besides the sensory pleasure that takes one away from their misery, and that only makes things worse in the long term. What is said person supposed to do when every decision they have made in their entire life has been one of full-fledged regret leading to an avoidance of ones own existence? Well, we are nothing more than the choices we have made. I therefore regret my own existence.

My life has been dictated by a few decisions I made when I was young that I refuse to accept. In other words, a rejection of the facts; nothing good comes from that, only misery. However, there is no other option. I have met the person I could have been and know the person I am know. This is the definition of despair and existing in the fiery pits of hell. Hell is not a place to go, it exists inside your mind in the compulsive pulling away from here to the ideas of what could have been. It is the knowledge of squandered potential. When you have experienced it, nothing is worse. I have squandered every privilege that has been bestowed on me. I refuse to acknowledge the limitations of my future and the existential dissonance between the person I could have been, the person I am now, and the limits of my future potential. For the last 7 years I have know that my life ended before it started based on some mistakes 15 years ago.

What brings a happy life? Well, that very well may be success/achievements/fulfillment is tasks that bring meaning and passion. But what are those concepts to some with so much self distain? They are so far across the existential landscape that it would take 1,000 lifetimes in order to reach them. How does this manifest in ones actions, persona, and drive? Well I will tell you from experience, hopelessness is doomed to be riddled throughout your existence. All passions, desires, and interests are squandered. Any fire that lights within you gets no further than a spark before it is smothered by mere self-awareness.

I worked on my traumas, my social skills, fitness, hobbies, friendships, career, etc. I built myself up from being a degenerate to someone that, whilst not perfect, I loved and felt that I could truly begin to share myself with the world. It was great for a time but it was fleeting. I've since moved from where I was, struggled to find friends despite getting out, I'm struggling to maintain the standard of excellence I so thoroughly came to love about myself, and it's really been exacerbated by the tons of platonic & romantic rejection I've faced. 

I truly feel unlovable and I just want to be held. I want to end it all. I do so much just to try and make it to the end of each day and I hate how no matter what I do, I find that the love I wish I could experience is something that simply won't be a part of my life. I can't control how other people feel about me so I will continue to focus on my life, what makes me happy, and doing my best to be a good person.

So I think. The only reason I'm not dead is because I haven't bought a firearm yet and I couldn't let my dog go back to a shelter if someone were to find me. I'm in so much pain and I just want to feel loved. I'm touch starved and I don't want someone or need a woman to be the entirety of my life... I just wish that despite my fancy fucking finance job, physique, and all of the things about my personality/character that my friends, family, and peers all claim to make me so worthwhile - that I could just be loved... 

I'm at my wit's end and I just want to die. I don't want to be alone anymore...",1680498375.0

attractive”. i don’t even believe my bf when he tells me he finds me attractive. i’m sick and tired. i actyally get more annoyed when he compliments me because it feels as though it’s out of pity. i’m too far gone to be “fixed” and have endured tooo much trauma to just live normally. not sure when, but i wanna do it. i’m tired of being jealous and filled with hatred. suggesting therapy won’t help either because lord knows i need it but i can’t afford it .",1680498316.0

I 23F was having consensual sex with a guy 28M I went on a few dates with. I was on top and then suddenly he flipped me to his lap to give him a blowjob, he had his hand around my neck and was holding my neck to move it up and down. He later kept grabbing my head to push it up and down and he kept pushing harder until I was gagging. I told him to stop. Then he started to face fuck instead.

It was days later that I started to feel violated. Just gross, dirty, worthless, and episodes of rage. I kept having anxiety from the flashbacks and breaking down randomly. I still feel nauseous. I’ve lost a lot of weight. When I told him that it was affecting me mentally ( gave no details) He told me if I’m “too nervous or pussy to go down there” I shouldn’t be doing it and he called me a “past pretense pussy victim”.

Anytime I see or hear anything related to blowjobs( which used to be my favorite thing) I get that tingly sensation in my mouth that people get when they’re about to vomit. I see so many comments about how its difficult to date a SA victim or no one wants to date them. I loved sex and now I feel dirty and gross. I’ve experienced sexual assault before and used to have anxiety attacks, but my reaction was never this over powering and intense. If he just asked it mightve been fine but the lack of consent and callous attitude was even further violating. 

I’m even shaking and crying typing this I dont know if I could be happy anymore when every second is a flashback, verge of tears, and loss of appetite. And its been over a month now since it happened. I’m still traumatized by other events of SA before this one because it was someone I trusted I don’t know if

If not thousands of post a day it will definitely get buried in the matrix but if you got this far cool thank you . 

I deleted my old account, I wanted to start fresh, a clean slate. Someone you might remember me, “agreessivegurr” something like they. Last December I got really sick from withdrawals. I ended up in the hospital and would you believe it? I got Covid up there. My heart rate wouldn’t go past 46. I felt like it was going to stop every time I went to sleep, so I was hospitalized again in my head the whole time I’m like “I wanna die like this I don’t want to die in this hospital I want to die on my own terms“. Here I am again, nothing changes if nothing changes. I can’t change my ways and I can’t change my thinking, it’s not enough to just think your family and the people that all her if I leave behind, it’s not . And scaring me to death didn’t work. 


I never believed in Toughlove, because there’s no love in it , still planning on going one day before my 40th birthday still alone going on 7 years and 3 months. 7 years and 3 months without someone to touch to hold to talk to, even to cuddle with and just cry to this voluntary isolation  is enough to drive anybody into a madness and that has irreversible damage, The last girl that I “dated” (I use that term loosely because we didn’t do anything. I think she was ashamed to be with me around her straight friends. ) which is exactly 7 years and three months ago, (almost a decade ago “)  was right , most people that I’ve walked away from are now married with kids living these happy ever after lives and don’t you guys dare come on here and tell “me it’s not what it seems” and “People have their own problems too.” I don’t wanna hear it if you’re in a relationship and you have kids you’re doing pretty good in my eyes. My last gf (7yrs ago) told me I was broken so I started doing drugs again thinking it would help because last time it did last time drugs made the world bearable, and gave me courage. I was going out to bars by myself to concerts by myself. I don’t care what people think but this time around  it’s not, I don’t know I guess I’m just really understanding why people take their lives this too painful and we just want the suffering to end.

This is the side you dont hear the LGBTQ talk about, the fact that many if not all of us would give anything just to be normal, so we don’t have to be alone and settle for someone that we’re not really into this because they’re like us I would give anything to be straight in normal.

Not had much good advice or anything to be honest and it makes me feel sick to my stomach because im tired of this life and feeling this way. Let me say I have not tried suicide but I think of it regularly . I dont think id do it to my siblings but damn i do genuinely feel tired of life

Ok so this might seem like a troll post but its not. Its kinda long too. Im posting this to a few forums cuz i need to vent and my mental health is suffering. Forgive me if this isnt allowed here just remove it. I just need to feel someone cares or listens even if you dont.
Im 39 m london. My whole life ive wanted a muscular girlfriend. In fact ive never had a relationship . Ive only ever been attracted to muscular women but never met any in person. Zero. I cant help it, normal women just dont do it for me. I hate it and hate feeling shallow but i cant help it. I dont think id be happy with someone regular. Obviously i know muscle doesnt last forever so personality matters , i just would have liked to meet a woman whos muscular and experience it . Its not all that matters especially long term but i cant give up on that.  But normal women just dont attract me. Even if i dated one i wouldnt be interested in them sexually it would basically be just companionship.  There would be nothing else to it so why not just be friends? I cant help what I find attractive, i wish i could

Another problem is my whole life ive suffered crippling depression. I also stopped caring about life and got really fat. So naturally i feel its unfair to want a muscular gf when ic ant get fit myself. Yet i also find it hard to beat my depression feeling alone. I always hoped id find someone who could help me get fit and develop a relationship with but it never happened.

Ive been in so ,many fights online over the years verbally because i tried reaching out to fit women and always got ignored. That always triggered me because ive always felt invisible. I also have a mental,learning disability so im not exactly what youd call a catch. Im torn between knowing most muscular women wouldnt want me and hoping for someone who will. But it lead to so many arguments i regret. Ive been resentful for a long time of dudes who get muscular women. Really bitter. Its made me angry. I said a lot of vile shit to people and hurt people i regret because i felt rejected and ignored. I have tried my best to beat this with therapy but i still do it occasionally and i hate it. It makes me feel like im back at square one when i fight online with someone . I know its illogical and i know no one owes me a response,i know im in the wrong to insult. But the pain and being alone blots out my logic until later when im remorseful as hell.

I decided two years ago to try. To not give up on life which is where i was for most of my life. But its so so hard. I want to be decent and worthy of these women. But i also know even if i get fit i dont even know any muscular women so it makes it feel even more pointless when im feeling down. Because i do want to be fit but im not a fan of exercise and really am trying to get fit not just for health but because i find it unfair i want a fit woman when im not fit myself. But its so so hard to stay positive.

I am trying to be a decent less bitter angry person. It hurts to see guys who are living a life with a woman who seems great with every quality i love. I know im not entitled to love and try to remember that. I try to remember when ive been mean and rude and how i dont wanna be that way.

One woman specifically i truly began to care for and it ended in a bad argument, she later forgave me but stopped talking. Id do anything for that friendship back but i caused its loss and thats on me
Ive made some progress. Since jan ive gone from 131kg to 124 just under. But i dont feel much better and feel so far to go. And in addition i found i had a pituitary brain tumour so i need surgery at some point as well as find ing out its what cause me low test all my life. I feel so much is against me. I even feel sometimes if i die during surgery id feel better

I know this has been kinda a self pity rant i just needed to tell someone because i dont have anyone to talk to. Idk if anyone cares i just feel rock bottom. Im not giving up yet , i will keep trying to be better. Its just so hard and right now ive never felt more alone
I feel so so fucking hopeless and down it hurts in my chest",1680468067.0
173,Society doesn't want me,3,129xdlr,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/129xdlr/society_doesnt_want_me/,0,"In so many ways I'm the kind of person the world at large isn't interested in having around or treating with dignity. I'm trans, I'm a racial minority, I'm in poverty constantly dancing right on the edge of homelessness, I'm an abuse victim, I'm gay, I'm autistic, and I'm schizophrenic.

For all these things people have generally treated me like dirt. At work, in school, in my family, with partners, roommates, friends. I'm told a lot the person I am isn't good or even real characteristics I can have. But still I go to work everyday. Making barely enough for my share of the rent and for some food. Without a license I walk 4 miles to and from work everyday often around 4am to make it on time. Dealing with severe hallucinations and paranoia all the way on my falling apart shoes. When I finally get there I'm bullied by coworkers and bosses alike for my characteristics especially being trans and autistic, often in ways subtle and passive aggressive enough to make me look insane and pedantic for standing up for myself. 

I'd get another job but with only walking available to me I can't go to many places in this small town. I'd apply for disability for all my mental health bullshit but it takes 2 years to see any benefits, if I could even succeed, and 2-3 years to see section 8 housing help me. 

The thing that pisses me off is there are plenty of things I love about life. I have a few great friends, a good sister, and a pet cat I love. I love painting and writing even though I'm no good at either. But with the constant exhaustion and need to work all these hours I'm either working or recovering from work. And I don't have the time, energy, or money to do anything that makes life worth living, or spend time with the people I love. What the fuck else should I do besides die?

The person said I had the wrong number so to double check, I sent them requests for the money on the same app they asked money from me. With both offers on the table: the whole amount or the repayment plan. The first thing they did was reject the repayment plan offer and then they rejected the full amount.

184,I need to die one way or the other,3,129webz,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/129webz/i_need_to_die_one_way_or_the_other/,1,"One of the most frustrating aspects of dealing with suicidal ideation is having to constantly coax oneself off the roof.

It is almost a reflex when something happens to want to kill myself. So I often I have to convince myself that it is work staying.

 I also have a worldview that if I off myself, I have to go through these experiences again, or rebalance a karma, or feel the weight of my decision or some fucking shit.

I do not want to pass on pain or hatred. 

I do not want to cause more shit to others but at the same time, that pisses me off. I feel like I am just stuck between wanting to leave this experience and not being able to because I will be fucked either way. It pisses me off that I am stuck and every day I hear a new reason for why I go through what I go through.

First it was my fucking brain, then my bloodline, then it was my parents with trauma, then it’s the shitty toxic environment, now I am hearing the spirits are antagonizing me. 

Dafuq, so was this a game worth living? So I am alive to just die in a fun exciting way.

That makes me angry. The anger is also un-pointed, I do not know who the fuq to blame. I don't know if I am not doing treatment well enough, did I run hard enough, did I do enough, enough, enough, enough.

Right now there is nothing I can do but die without physical death. Let my name be trash, fail, loose, win a little, get some dumb job, pick up another addiction until it fucks up an organ in my 50s and then I just OD on the meds?

My mental health and issues continue to make college almost unbearable. Now all I am doing is barely passing. Psychiatry don't work and talk therapy fixes nothing. 

So what is my solution, die without death. Just forget everything and empty the fucking cup and just pray that this life is a short one where I die on some accident…or maybe a freaky disease. That way no-one else gets hurt. I am so fucking tired.

Please help! I don't know how to carry on. I don't want to die but the pain of living is unbearable. :( Here's what happened: basically I had a falling out with a very close friend, losing my home in the process. Maybe normally someone could handle this kind of pain, but after all I've been through I just really really can't :( I'm at my limit.

I grew up with little to few friends, my  parents were drug addicts. Then when I turned 18, 3 months before I  graduated highschool my dad died and all my friends left for college and  I stayed home to deal with my dad's death. I was born intersex and  never quite fit in. I lived first as male, then as female in middleschool and highschool. When I was around 20 I decided I wanted to  be male permanently.

&#x200B;

I went to an evil surgeon that botched me really badly, abandoned me, then tried to sue my family. I  had horrible nerve damage and almost died, if my mom wasn't in the  hospital at the time I would've died. This was when I first truly felt disposable. I was in a coma for 3 weeks and had infections for 2 years. The infections ate away at every part of my  body. Mainly my face. I did not go outside for 10 years.

I spent those 10 years in various hospitals trying to fix my nerve damage and face so I would just look normal again. It took  this long to finally become somewhat comfortable enough with my disabilities to go back to college and talk to people. But I still have extreme anxiety about being abandoned or people hating me or not liking me.

I met ""James"" in college during lockdown. School seemed accessible because it was on zoom, I was less self conscious about my appearance. We became really good friends. We got along instantly and he inspired me to do in  person classes and drive again. Eventually he asked me to be his roommate and for the first time in my life I had someone that cared  about me when I came home. That loved me. That was a true genuine  friend. Someone to cook meals with, watch shows with, that had all the  same interests as me. I loved him more than anyone else in the world. He  was my true family.  We've been close friends for 3 years. I was finally truly blessed with the happiness I always dreamed of.

However he was worried I was codependent on him, so he asked me to  distance myself. I didnt know how to or what he meant, so I became toxic  and mean at times. I stopped staying at his apartment for months  because I was worried he would hate me and that he needed space (also my cat missed me but that's another issue). Worst  of all, I sent in my notice last December that I would be moving. Looking back at it, it was a super passive aggressive notice. I wasn't sure if he had asked me to move, I wanted him to tell me he wanted me to stay, like I was testing the relationship. So toxic of me! I just didn't know if he liked me anymore, that's how sick my brain was despite all the constant positive reassurance he would send me.

He got very upset (understandably) and said he would no longer speak to me and we were no longer friends. This was Christmas eve when he told me this, I  also caught covid that day, so moving and isolating was extremely hard. I tried to apologize and rescind the notice because I never wanted to move, I loved my home, but it didn't matter, it was too late, the damage was done. I would never be forgiven.

After the move I have been hopeless. I dropped all my classes. I  literally just cry all day and night, knowing I lost the one good thing  that ever happened to me in my wretched life. I cant go back to living how I  lived before, at my mom's house, never going out, and praying for death everyday. It's all I talk about. It's all I think about. I have tried  multiple times to reach out to James but it is met with silence or a  block. I cant believe it. I just can't believe this nightmare is real. It's been 4 months now.

I feel disposable. It's hard not to believe I am worthless. I hate myself. I know that is not James's intent, I know he was just hurt by my moving, but I still feel discarded. I hate my life. I hate what I did to James, that I hurt the person I loved the most in the world so much by accident. That I threw away our happiness. I hate what I did. I hate who I was. I hate knowing what I lost. I will never live another day happy knowing what I lost.

I just want to die so I can stop  feeling this pain. I miss James so much. I miss my life so much. I can't  do this anymore. I can't live anymore. I want to die. I'm posting this here because I've tried reaching out to other ""professional"" places and I just get crappy 1 sentence answers like ""can't you see another way forward?"" like no betch, that's why I'm fucking killing myself jesus christ. smh.

As a side note, during the time right before the notice to move I had a therapist that was VERY bad for me. While it is not her fault for me allowing her to make my decisions, she pushed me in all the wrong directions even when I would be like ""u sure??? I know I have this toxic mindest u sure???"" she ultimately pushed me to just send a letter to move, then when I told her what happened she was like ""welp that's our last session I thought that would happen"" Aaaaaaa I have never been so pissed in my life. Again, not her fault, but I am mad at myself for trusting her. So yes I have tried therapy, but it will take me a long time before I can trust a therapist again.

195,How do I tell my family/close friends about my suicide attempt ?,5,129lfc1,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/129lfc1/how_do_i_tell_my_familyclose_friends_about_my/,2,"Hi, 22F, I hope this belong to this sub. I am really lost and I really need advice. The following text will be context. There is a tl;dr at the end.
>
Some days ago, I made a suicide attempt. I tried to jump off a bridge. I had been planning it for months, had been managing to hold me back thinking about my little siblings that I love so much, about my excellent friends and my parents. But the suicidal thoughts were getting stronger as I was going in one of my ""nightmare periods"" and real life problems were accumulating as well as the pressure of last year of college. I was SAed during my childhood (since I was 5yo) as well as witnessing extreme violence against other children, as I grew up in the countryside of a third world country. Today I live in Europe and I am far away from all that horror with my family, but it still messed me up. It broke me, trauma is a cage were I thought the only key would be death since I was 15. But I am the oldest sibling, so I had to keep it together, to be responsible, I tried so hard and never told anybody. It feels like I lived for others. 
>
So, some days ago I decided it was enough. I wanted to be ""selfish"" for once in my life. I put my plan into action. I went to the place. I was ready to do it, already over the fence, when a man appeared from nowhere and grabbed me, asking if I was alright. He startled me. I wasn't expecting it. I was completely emotionless til now but his voice broke the barrier I had built around myself and I started crying. He brought me down immediately. He saved my life. But not only that, he stayed for hours on this bridge with just me crying like I have never done before, he lended me his jacket, he listened to me when no one ever did, and then he spoke just the right words. He didn't bring up my family, he didn't spoke about religion. He just calmly reasonated with me, unraveling one by one the unspoken feelings. He invited me to a drink afterwards and spend a whole chunk of the night with me then took me back to my place after making sure I had called a friend for the night. I never would have thought I could be saved. I remember wishing so hard to be saved as a child, and no one ever did. What he did means the world to me. I was so ready to do it. If he wouldn't have been there, I would have done it. I know it. But he was and he changed my perspective. 
>
Now, I decided I don't want to just come back to my old life. I want to make a change. And I believe the first step to all of this is to first acknowledge what I almost did, and then work up from there. I want to tell my parents but that would imply also telling them about my SA. They don't know. I think they were clear signs back then, but they weren't educated to spot them anyway and I never told them cause I didn't want to be a burden or make them sad. But this way of thinking is what brought me to attempting. 
>
So how do I tell them ? And is it a good idea to tell my close friends ? The one I called the night it happened knows, but he is really mature and handled it well. I am scared the others will change completely their ways of apprehending me. But if I were them I know I would have liked to know. About the parents, do you have any experience with that ? Or advice to make it as ""gentle"" as possible ? I don't want to guilt trip them, I know it will make them sad but I don't know how sad and I want to limit the damage as much as I can. I also think it will be a shock for them cause I never ever told them anything I was feeling, and they always considered me the stable one and relied a lot on me. I am scared of taking away that help that I was providing them although I know I need to do it.
>
>
*Tl;dr : I want to tell my parents and close friends about my suicide attempt to try to make a change and heal myself, but telling it to my parents would also imply telling them about how I was victim of CSA. I need advice on the best way to handle that and handle the aftermath. It would be also needed to get therapy (I think it would help me). I can't afford it myself since I am still a student and my parents would immediately question me if I asked them without context. I tried once to ask them for it when I was 15 and they brushed it off as I refused to tell them why exactly (I was scared to tell them I had been SAed at the time)*",1680442389.0

213,In Spain with no “s”.,1,129zia4,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/129zia4/in_spain_with_no_s/,0,"I am diagnosed with BPD (among other mental and chronic illnesses). I genuinely wonder if I’ll ever be able to have a healthy relationship (specifically because of the BPD). When I make strong decisions that I believe are good and healthy boundaries for myself….I then can never tell if I am correct or not after the fact. Then I am just confused, I feel like I am being gaslit by my own brain. I just can’t keep feeling not loved. 

My long term relationship (we also live together), is currently at a crossroads. Now I am sitting here wondering if I just made up all this stuff that I thought I had FINALLY had space to communicate to my partner about….I-… I feel SUCH A DEEP AMOUNT OF AGONIZING PAIN AND CONFUSION!! It feels like my brain is sabotaging ME AND MY RELATIONSHIP. I don’t know which side is up. I feel like I am drowning. I have such a hard time feeling love.

I just hurt so bad ALL THE TIME. My emotional pain is often so large that it manifests itself IN PHYSICAL PAIN TOO. I’ve had seizure like episodes in relation to my mental health. It is ripping me apart from the inside. I feel like I am have a Large McDouble “Combo Mental Illnesses Episode”, happening right now. I want to just put my thoughts in a blender and put it on pulse a few times. I have so much rage and fury and anger inside of me. Bc I am tired of not feeling loved and I cannot tell if it’s ME or my partner. (Among a few other large issues)

I have half my clothes packed. But I have no where that’s in the state that I could go, if I decide to leave. If I did, I would have to go half way cross country to stay (closest & safest) and I do not have a whole lot of extra cash for gas. (Currently unemployed bc I took FMLA, then afterwards I needed ADA accommodations and they denied them.)
Also, I am making car payments still and I would not have the right to work in another state and I have medicine, doctors appointments, therapy that I all need very badly that I wouldn’t have access to ALL THAT if I decided to leave now for another state. 

Genuinely, during the conversations my partner and I have had during this crossroads I’ve managed to keep myself feeling non-suicidal, until I started packing my stuff and it just broke me even more than I was before. Unsavory thoughts are already a pretty constant battle in my day to day life. So now I just keep splitting into every emotion, including feeling numb and suicidal, because of the BPD.

I just want my life back.

hi,uhm,i am quite anxious so i will try to do my best ok?

Ok, so basically im a guy age 17.

Loneliness is something that i have lived for a huge chunk of my pathetic life.

My loneliness was mostly because of my weird passions such as: Weapons, History,Manga to name a few. 

Besides the fact im living with ADHD,Depression and Mood Swing Disorder(yes,it is  medically checked not self-diagnosed. I was diagnosed with it at 13) i have to be lonely all the time. I literally have no friends,i had a girlfriend which i loved her to death. 

I truly loved her, i cared so much for her because she was going through a lot of turbulent times ,but she said its better for her to breakup and im too good for her.

Like ffs, i cant even have friends that i can go out with, but like my classmates already have future wives and husbands ffs.

I tried to commit seppuku multiple times(yes like actually how the samurais did it) because i feel so hopeless and i feel that life is moving at such a pace that i literally can not keep up.

Therapy does not help.(I did therapy for like 2 months)

And before i finish this i really want to know: What does it mean to be human and What does it mean to be invincible under the sun?

I do not want to die alone because that is one of my biggest fears in life.

And btw if you have read this till the end:Peace be Upon you and your loved ones.

My therapist says these thoughts are distorted and not true and that I don’t have to let them control me blah blah. Everyone has heard it before, it may be true but it doesn’t make me feel any better. 

I think about suicide a lot, probably every day, I don’t remember a day it hasn’t crossed my mind. Life is hard to struggle through and for little reward. It’s hard to even want to recover because suicide is always there looming over my head. In my head I think about why I would even want to recover if I’m just going to kill myself anyway.

Today was the first time I somewhat consciously planned my own death and it took way too long for me to realize what was happening.

I feel like a burden to everyone around me and while planning to take my own life I actually thought about organising my funeral and writing down all my usernames and passwords just so that I am finally not a burden on my family and society anymore.

When your main problem with bpd is thinking people hate you and then all your friends have multiple parties and don’t even tell you let alone invite you, they don’t ever message you first and take days to reply when you text first and your ex keeps coming in and out and saying how sorry they are and then not messaging you for two weeks. 

I genuinely haven’t felt like this in years, I fully relapsed into drinking every day again. 
If I’m not drunk I’m high and I’m about ten minutes away from self harm relapse and pretty fucking close to trying to kill myself again.

I know something is wrong with me because I can’t do anything anymore without feeling terrified (like a life/death fear). For the past years, it’s not something that I can just “push thru” or “get over with” like what my family says to me. 

I used to talk to my sister about this. But lately she’s become frustrated and doesn’t really converse with me like before. She even has a judgmental and angry tone now. I tried yesterday as a last naively hopeful chance she could comfort me but I ended up feeling like the enemy/ antagonist in the room. She didnt even try to listen just cut me off and said “don’t do that to me” in a really angry tone. Truthfully she never took my side in anything. She never just listened when I needed to vent, always had something to say or that what I felt was wrong or I should just not care. Even though I always listen to her rants and try to help with her problems. 

So now I don’t have anyone irl to speak with. I don’t have anyone who will listen without judgment/annoyance/scrutiny. 

When I think of my parents, relatives, friends or people irl it makes me feel nauseous and disgusted. Now when I think of my sister I’ve been feeling the same. 

What’s worse is how I have no belief in myself at all. No hope. No love. Nothing. When I see my reflection I feel disappointment. 

I can’t even cope anymore. None of the things that used to help make my life a bit more bearable work anymore. 

My sister had similar job ptsd but overcame it on her own. She’s got a better job now she’s been in for the past few years. Why did she overcome it but I could not? 

I’ve always been weird and emotional. Idk. I never felt like I belonged in any group or relationship, not even with my own family.

I really can’t be a normal person. I can’t function like a normal adult should. I can’t even write coherently anymore. It sounds lame but I don’t think anyone will ever understand me or truly help me. I feel so alone in this world and in this life. I can’t live anymore. I need to kms today or tomorrow. But I gotta do it soon and I got be successful with it. If I don’t I’ll just experience more hatred and isolation.

I have no family, no job (due to my mental health & other disorders), no hobbies, no passions. So why cant I just go? 

I am one of those people who made promises to myself; “I’ll go when I turn 14”, then 14 became 16, and 16 became 18, and the next closest is 21, but I know I won’t do it, so there’s no point in promising it to myself this time.

I want to go. I am sure. If I qualified for assisted suicide, I would take it. If I just knew it wouldn’t hurt. 

It’s always, “it’ll get better soon”, but hearing it for 10 years makes me think people don’t know what soon means.",1680452697.0

Many will say it's ironic to say you're tired at such a young age, cause 'life has so many beautiful things to give'. But to be honest, I'm not even going to bother trying to convince those people for a little bit of empathy.

I just want some advice or something.

Every day I wake up, feeling like ass. Already tired before the day has even started.

I feel nothing but toxicity, self hatred and negativity and I can't help but push away friends and family.

I started self harming again and it's hard to get out of bed.

I guess I’ll leave this here, and not think about consequences for once. It’s been a very long time since I’ve felt happy, and looking out ahead over the next chapter of my life, I’m not too reassured. 
	
I was brought up in a radically conservatively religious community that is completely insular from the world outside of it. Just the fact that I’m on a Reddit forum would be enough to have most of the leadership agree to excommunicate me. I am not exaggerating. 

	I was sent to a hyper religious private school all through high school and even for some sort of post high religious study. I still strongly believe in God, but my day to day religious practice has taken back seat. I was bullied pretty badly in primary and middle schools. I was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age and went through the entire rotation of stimulants and medications parallel to my school years, though I am not currently on anything. I dealt with a short bout of serious depression during my senior year, resulting in me dropping out for a short time. 
	
Approximately nine months ago, I was smacked with seemingly untriggered panic and anxiety that was intense enough to get in the way of my daily schedule, and deeply scare me in the process. At the time, I was completely dependent on my parents, and asked them to help me find some professional help. It was overlooked and played off for too long, but finally, after about three months of acute panic attacks 5-10 times a week, I had an appointment with a psychiatrist, (not a therapist or psychologist). 
	
Days before my long awaited appointment, my father sat me down, laid out some small perceived disrespects I sent his way, and declared he decided it wasn’t a good idea for me to live in his house anymore. Remember: I was still in boarding school and had absolutely no cash towards starting my life. Hell, I didn’t even have my driver’s license. I was able to go back to school, but when the term ended, I was on the streets. No, it wasn’t a nice climate. It was New Jersey in November. I spent several nights desperately walking the streets in the rain, absolutely exhausted, and willing myself not to sleep, lest someone steal my knapsack with everything I own inside of it. Simultaneously, and understandably, my panic attacks quickly became more intense and more frequent. 

	After about three weeks of being completely homeless, and squatting on some couches, my mom reached out and offered I come back. After much negotiating, and a half-assed apology from my dad, I agreed to “move back in”, even though then I was still in boarding school, and the term was coming up. I went off to school, but my spark was extinguished. I no longer felt any joy in my life. I tried. I truly gave it a good shot. 
	
There was nothing I found enjoyable anymore, only passions. Music is a big one. I used to enjoy music. I am a musician and an aspiring songwriter. But now I’m just passionate about music. I care about music so much. I just don’t enjoy it. The same stands for any hobby or interest I had. Either I lost interest or I lost enjoyment. I began to spend more time contemplating life, its meaning, and pain. Pain is now something I can never not think about. I’ve experienced it, so has every person I meet today, and everyday. Everyone was hurt by someone. Someone they trusted, or cared for, or even someone they had never met or spoken to again. There is too much pain on the planet for me to be happy. I came to the realization that the state of happiness is just that of forgetting your pain for short periods. When I saw that, I knew I would never be happy. I feel things too deeply, think about things too much, and I sometimes even uncontrollably seek out more of other people’s pain to feel for them. It’s almost an addiction, an addiction for reality. 

	I don’t know if I will kill myself. The only reason I haven’t killed myself, though, is because I don’t want to hurt the people close to me that badly. They would be devastated, and I know my sister will be changed for life by that trauma. She doesn’t deserve that. On the other hand, I have not a bit of fear for death, outside of instinctual flinching. I have been trying really hard not to harm my wrists, but I have the urge daily, and carry a knife wherever I go. Even if I were to start seeing a therapist now, I don’t know how long it’ll be before I am able to trust and be this vulnerable with them. 

	Around three months ago, I parted ways with my school. They didn’t want me to be there and unproductive. I went “home”, have had a cool relationship with both my parents, and mostly have been doing nothing in my bed. My parents are scared to upset me, so they don’t pressure me to do anything with myself. I have had fleeting interest in various job opportunities, but they’re always that; fleeting. 
	
What frightens me most? I don’t see any change in sight. I have been making dates, “Everything will be back to normal by January,” but it has been nearly a year since this whole saga began, and I can’t imagine being contented ever again. My probability of suicide may be comparatively low, but if on one night I’m at serious risk, it’ll be that one year anniversary. If you’re still reading this, you’re one of the good ones, and it’s people like you (if you exist) that uphold my heartbeat of faith in this world. If you have dealt with something similar, or have dealt with any pain at all, I am so deeply sorry and you do not deserve it. 

Thank you.",1680465417.0

249,"Good listener, Poor Talker.",3,129lz3k,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/129lz3k/good_listener_poor_talker/,0,"I told my friend this after we shared our problems:

""It is easy to open up to someone. We all want to be heard *by someone we trust*. 
What's difficult is the pang of anxiety that comes after sharing something personal. Then the feeling of vulnerability and hesitation creeps in knowing that you've shown the *real you* and worry that it's going to be something others would use to hurt you in the future. Thinking you shouldn't have said it and feel uncomfortable and ponder what in the hell the other person is thinking about whatever you have shared.  
With the right person, it'll be assuring. God, I hope.

At least, in my perspective.
I've been told not to share anything to anyone no matter how intimate the relationship is but that's from the people who they themselves are backstabbers.

I usually just listen and process anything anyone says until I miss the opportunity to say something. Lmao. 
Which is why they say I'm quiet because my train of thought is hijacked by beleaguered bandits.""  
  
After that conversation, he told me that I will someday find someone better to miss and that I should not worry about him.  
  
Those words disturbed my perceptive composure.  
I only laughed it out and expressed my agitation derisively.  
  
Does he want to get rid of me? I thought.  
  
He then says the nicest things afterwards, I had replied with an irresolute ""Okay"".  
He did not like it.  
I didn't know why he did that, I never asked even, which was stupid of me.  
  
He confronted me about my efforts of impressing him and my need of his reassurance.  
Flustered because of the disconcerting situation, I denied the truth. He was already telling his thoughts about death while I was feeling insensitive.
Things got rougher afterwards and now we have left things with unresolved aggression.  
  
I still overthink about this predicament.

I doubt anyone I know would take me seriously anymore either, I've already vented too many times that it's like the boy who cried wolf. I can't even go into detail about what's happened today because it's just too much.
And I actually stopped posting for a while because I thought I was getting better. I tried drugs a while back (well, ""weed""/THC gummies)and they gave me a panic attack but they made me fear dying so I thought ""at least I don't feel like dying anymore"" but here I am. Weed probably just made me feel worse.
And I'm fucking scared.
I'm still scared to die, but the feeling of being so in pain that I think about ceasing to exist is back. 
I'm scared of everything, the future and where my life is going, and my inevitable death.

i don't want to live like this either.

Do they hate me that much? I wish I hated people as much as they hated me.  Or maybe something does happen after death, I'm not religious but with how I was raised I still get scared of the possibility of a hell existing. I don't want to suffer for eternity.

I've seen countless doctors, and their conclusions have been the same. It's in my head, and to continue taking my medications (antidepressants). Over the year of 2022 it had completely changed my outlook on life and the future going forward. 

I've been suffering from extreme fatigue, disorientation, dizziness, muscle rigidity, shaking/tremors, muscle Jerks. As well as a heavy heartbeat, a heavy pulse, massive headaches, and a heavy pressure in my head. There were days where I couldn't stand for 10 minutes at a time. I'd be trying to always sit at work because I couldn't stand. I would stagger and trip over myself. And the symptoms have been so erratic.

Today, I still suffer this malaise, however not as strongly. I've become entirely depressed and lethargic. Hopeless.

I used to be very physically active, and with my own home gym. But this illness would affect any physical activity, worsening the symptoms.

I've tried describing these symptoms again and again to so many doctors. I was almost at the end of my rope about a month ago, when I went and checked myself into the ER at the hospital. We did an ekg, chest x-rays and blood work. By the end of it I was taken into a room with a ""mental health expert"". I was told to take my medication. That I was physically fine. And that was that.

In that moment, I felt an unease from the worker. I was in this position over 5 years ago after a suicide attempt which put me in the mental ward for 18 days. But at the same time I didn't trust this worker to try and understand my serious illness. 

Jesus christ, I'm suffering every day, and I have been for over a year and a half. And when I try and find hope and seek help from trained and licensed individuals, I hope to find answers or a cure. Especially with today's modern medicine. Instead, I've continuously been tossed aside. I'm a statistic to them.

And to me, hope in life was a determination that things would get better. It was actively fighting an uphill battle, that I was willing to push through. I've learned so much in the last 5 years after my suicide attempt. And I use everything I've learned as a tool against my depression. But since this illness and the zero effort I get from doctors, I no longer feel that things will get better.

I've lost that hope.

I hardly see a future for myself, and I no longer fear the consequence of death.

I'm in debt, enough to really inhibit any meaningful savings.

I love my spouse, or at least who they pretended to be before we got married. But truth be told I don't even think they like me, let alone love me. I can't afford to leave them or live on my own. Besides, even though I am holding a job, I am still disabled and I question my ability to live independently.

I can't move home...it would be a death sentence as my aging narcissist (diagnosed) father loses his faculties. Fun fact, narcissism and aging do not mix. And I know I'd be forced to assist with caring for him.

I tried different types of therapy and it did nothing, I really don't see the point or how it could ever help me. To top it all off my younger sister is horribly abusive and I live in fear of her 24/7 as there's no way I could afford to move to my own place considering how much I pay for my medication plus my dog's prescription food. Even when she's not being abusive to me she and my mom get into screaming matches regularly which makes my already terrible anxiety even worse, these days I can't even be in the same room with them both at the same time without having a panic attack.

I went for a walk this morning after taken strong pain killers and thought I’d get some fresh air as mentally I wasn’t feeling good. I seen a police car go past and this might sound silly but I completely broke down. 

I wanted to be a police officer. 

My whole life that’s all I wanted to do. It was my purpose it’s all I could think about doing with my life. 

The last 7 years I have been experiencing chronic pain and really got not further forward apart from finding out I have an ovarian cyst on my left ovary November last year. 2021 I had a camera which cleared my from IC and they couldn’t see anything else. I have lost my relationship over all this and have more recently in the last two years been struggling mentally with it all and I’m a very independent person and can usually deal with everything alone but this is to much even for me.  

My cyst will need to be removed as it is large and causing me severe pain. I have been giving loads of different pain killers but it’s not solving the problem. It could be a long time before I can have surgery and talks of endometriosis have been mentioned. When I heard all this last year I had my first attempt but was found and although I was found dead paramedics got me back unfortunately and the police were involved. 

I have never felt right since , my neck and bottom of my back have always been in pain since and my head always hurts. Yeah, that’s how it happened… anyways 

I’m currently unemployed at the moment. I needed to get my driving license and get a bit more active again before applying for the police force however I can’t because of the pain I’m in and it’s stopping me from doing the most simple of things. I know I’m only 22 but I want to be progressing and doing what I want to do. I don’t drink or smoke or socialise at all. I don’t have family I’m in contact with. I have a very quiet solo life and I enjoy that. I just want to be where my heart is at but it’s never going to happen. Even if they remove my cyst and find endometriosis (which they said was most likely) or something else like that I don’t want to have this pain anymore or be in and out of hospital for surgery’s. I also know you have stages of endometriosis… I wouldn’t be able to be an officer. 

It’s frustrating and devastating. 

I know some people might think that job isn’t worth it all as I’m aware of peoples opinions however it was my dream and that’s what really hurts as it will only ever be a dream. 

Feel like just doing it again because all I feel is pain and sadness. When it happened it was done and over and that was it. I’m stubborn in my ways I don’t want help because it’s not going to stop all this but ending it all will. 

They say S***** is a permanent fix to temporary problems but in my circumstances it’s the solution to my problem.",1680436356.0

301,I'm afraid of what reaching out for help will look like.,9,129a404,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/129a404/im_afraid_of_what_reaching_out_for_help_will_look/,12,"I have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts on and off for about 15 years I realize tonight. I have mentioned it rather off handedly to friends before, who spoke about having similar feelings at one point or another, but the only person I ever fully admitted to struggling with thoughts of self harm was my ex. We had already been in a relationship for 3 years at that point and were living together, but the first and only thing they told me, was if my mental health got any worse, then they would leave me. I haven't really felt super (or at all) comfortable talking about it since then. 

I have a small support network of people who I have been able to be honest with about how difficult the past couple years have been (relationship abuse, shitty breakup, then getting jumped and the following court case where the people got off). But because it's the people closest to me who are my support network, and love me most, I find I can't bring myself to tell them how much I'm really struggling because I know it would crush them. 

The only thing that has kept me from trying to kill myself most days for the past many months is the guilt I feel of how badly it would hurt these couple of people. The pain and suffering I would cause by harming myself.

Because I think I know nowadays that I'm not a bad person- I did not know this for most my life, but I just can't bring myself to care about my life at all. I have lost any momentum I had because of some unfortunate events over the last couple years, and I've reached, arguably an all time low. 

I have an inability to plan for my future at all, because I can't envision one, and I don't really want one. I feel I have experienced so much suffering from the time I was a kid, and periodically throughout my life, that I just can't take it any more. I can't take any more heart break. I'm full already. 

I have looked into a little bit about treatment centres near me, but they seem kind of terrible. I fear it would make it worse. I fear being medicated, and confined. I have mentioned suicidal ideation to two different counsellors in the past ~8 months (kind of in a nonchalant cry for help) but they both didn't seem to really take it seriously at all and didn't bring it up again. Perhaps I am too good at being nonchalant. 

All this to say, is that I've never seriously admitted to any one how much I've struggled with wanting to kill myself most of my life, and it's clearly not something that I can will away from affecting me whenever I am struggling or depressed, so instead of scarring my family and closest friends, I think I should take some responsibility here. Before I just drive away and disappear from everyone's lives and then perhaps off the earth.

My family is so cruel and regularly wish death on me. Especially my jealous aunts and cousins.

Of course I’ll leave my ID and belongings in whatever hotel I’ll be staying at. 

This way I can’t be traced, and none of them will ever know what happened. None of them will laugh at my death, and they’ll forever wonder what happened to me. It’s not their privilege to know. They don’t deserve to know.  I don’t want them to be happy knowing I’ve killed myself.",1680451535.0
306,My life has gone downhill very quickly,2,129jemf,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/129jemf/my_life_has_gone_downhill_very_quickly/,0,"

I'm 27F, have a boyfriend of 1 year ( 29M). I work in an industry that's highly difficult to get into. I don't necessarily enjoy my job and the environment is toxic, but the experience can lead to other jobs within that field, so I wished to stay.

The last two weeks have been difficult.  I found out two weeks ago that my boyfriend, a suicidal drug addict, has been using again, after being sober for months. He lied to me, became angry and I haven't been brave enough to broach the subject again, despite having proof. Other than the addiction issues and his depression, our relationship is loving and I love him very much.

Last week, I was told  my contract with work would not be renewed. This is not standard in my workplace (most workers stay on contracts endlessly until obtaining permanency) and the situation is embarrassing and stressful. I had trouble adjusting to my new role and jept making mistakes. I have two months to find another job and I won't be able to get one in that field.

As a result of the contract loss, I resorted to old coping mechanisms and cut my forearm. My bf noticed today and queried it in a light, airy tone. I replied defensively, I'll admit, but not aggressively. I asked him to leave me alone. He stormed off on a walk, took some money without asking, came back hours later and has been cold ever since.

He won't say he loves me back and won't talk to me. I tried to explain I didn't want him to go, I just didn't want to talk about the self harm, as I am embarrassed. I've apologised over and over. I asked him what had upset him about what I said and he said he was ""over it"". We had a great weekend and, other than the arguments over using substances, which aren't often, we don't really argue. I don't know what he means.

I'm exhausted. I have a terrible relationship with my family, especially my mum, but all I want is her. I feel so alone, especially as my best and only close friend has been busy today. I want to die so badly that it's overwhelming. There's no solution for the mess that is my life. When things were okay, I still wasn't happy and feel I never will be. I love my boyfriend so very much and I'm worried I've ruined our relationship. I feel like I'm going to lose everything. 

I want to stop feeling. I want out. Please help me.",1680437429.0

But in myself, I’ve learned how much I’m truly habituated to the idea of killing myself. In that it’s truly clear it’s no longer a question of if (or even how), but when. 

I know I’m impulsive, so I’ve tracked my mood and overall Y/N to if or if not I should do it over the course of the last month. It’s looking very clear to me, as it has been since I was around 12. I’ve wanted to do this for so long, and it’s truly one true goal I know I can complete with virtually complete control over. My first attempt sadly failed so I put it off as I needed to perfect my plan. The inpatient was a joke and I think America should consider MAID programs. Still, I’ve had time to do perfect my own course of action. Of course 1 month isn’t enough, so I’ve allocated a few more months to gauge how my life will be at that time, and decide if I deem it worth living.

I’m not convinced anyone would be “better off without me,” and I know for certain some people love me. Still, I am infatuated with how much calm arises at the thought of the sudden stop of my own heartbeat - the stop of my trials, troubles , and overall ennui. I know others I have loved in this lifetime can get over it. Sometimes, I think about who I’d leave behind and cry a little; but when I purposefully stop taking breaths and stare out into space, a comfort arises. The tears.. stop.

Get depression mood swings out of nowhere, often caused by small things? I'll elaborate some more. I feel happy or okay about half the time, I think. But often seemingly out of nowhere I will fall into a deep depression that will vary and severity and longevity. For example, I'll be having a great day, feeling good, and then I'll read a post that makes me sad and then I just spiral from there. Or maybe my partner will say/do something that rubs me wrong, and then I end up depressed for anywhere from a few hours to a few days. It always seems impossible to shake away and my entire mindset changes, like I can't imagine ever being happy again, and often comes with light to serious s**cidal thoughts. And then I'll just randomly start feeling better after a while.

It makes me feel crazy, like when I'm in a better mood again I'll feel like I was faking it the whole time.

my partner has been struggling with suicidal thoughts for years already. Never anything concrete like a plan or even attempts, but it has been getting worse and she does slowly become more desperate.

One core aspect of her situation is that she does not seem to derive motivation, happiness or any kind of gratification from anything she does. She is diagnosed with depression, we went through a myriad of treatments (close to 20 different psychopharmaceuticals, therapies, and some more recent experimental treatments), up to the point that the doctors also just end up at ""gotta keep trying"". This of course just adds to her anguish.

I am unsure how else I can support her and help her. Simply being understanding is obviously not enough, as it just keeps getting worse, even with professional support over years. In her down moods, she asks things like ""how long do I have to keep suffering"" or ""I feel like I should just give up and die"". She is very introspective and deep-thinking, and spends a lot of her time contemplating her situation. She is frustrated at being human, being a mortal being constrained to a ""bag of flesh"" and dependent on the society around us. Hence a deep sense of alienation, but also the desire to be different from the rest (or from what makes us human in the first place), saying that while people may understand what she says, they do not truly understand or relate to her. She feels like a victim to her own mental and emotional state, and that even though she has goals and desires, being constrained by feeling miserable about anything she does. This craving for control over her feelings and emotions in bad situations peaks in the desire of not wanting to feel anything anymore - just to have the pain stop. 

As I said she is deep-thinking,  this is not some ""in-the-spur-of-the-moment"" thinking that emerges from a bad situation, but slowly developing over time, with a lot of contemplation going into it. And she is aware of all the ""objective"" reasoning why it would be worth living and to keep trying to find a solution, but it doesn't change her emotions about it. Rationally approaching things like this agitates her more, while showing understanding is not really seen as true understanding by her and is conflicting in nature due to her world view.

What can I do? How can I be more supportive for her? I read the [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/talking\_tips/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/talking_tips/), which overall is nice but doesn't provide anything new sadly (and rather some things advised in there would be trigger points for her too)",1680430666.0

The worst is that I'm still alone in all this, I made a new friend this year and I thought that he was gonna be here for me
I'm not expecting much, just for him to be by my side, to stop crying on my own idk
Turns out nothing has changed, nobody knows how much i'm thinking about suicide, I feel like I'm so ready for it and it's only getting worst 

The loneliness and isolation that comes with years of depression is probably the hardest, suffering alone is one of my greatest pain 

I have a therapist and I probably will be medicated soon, 
It's my last hope, if the meds don't work, I will have nothing to keep me here anymore 

If you have the possibility to reach out to someone please do,
When you feel like cutting the world out, please be careful, try to keep some people close, you don't want it to get this bad",1680430053.0

I have been struggling with many problems (health, depression etc…) for the last few years but now it’s seems to have reached a point of no return.
I always had some existential thoughts but never too profound but since some months now, I suffer from the thought of solipsism which is the fact of all people and the world being a product of my mind and being the only conscious person in the entire world. This thought is making me so isolated and feeling numb, I am suicidal due to it, since I am not interested of living in a world like this.
The question I ask myself is if some of you already went through this type of problem and did you manage to get out of the rabbit hole that is existential thoughts ?

I started to feel better with antidepressants, slowly worked towards keeping a stable routine and work towards my goals. I've always dreamed of becoming an artist for video games. Theres so many games that are near and dear to my heart, I want to be part of the creation of new games that will mean that much to someone else. 

With that motivation I signed up for an online art academy that I was super excited about. I started practicing regularly, and it felt like all I had to do was keep away my fears of failing. Trust that with enough time and dedication it was within the realm of possibility to become as good as my idols. 
Fast forward to January of this year, and on new years my father got sick and passed away. My mother whom I love and is the sun of my life has never felt more depressed and I just feel like I'm a burden for her. I tucked everything in to go get a job asap as our financial situation which wasn't particularly good beforehand went to shit. I had to drop out of the art school and now owe them way more money than I can afford now. And with all the ai art developments, none of it even feels worth it. I was amateur at best, and I suppose that at least I don't owe bachelor degree levels of debt, but it's still a lot of money and time for a skill that feels practically useless.

I had made myself hopeful and excited that if I worked towards that goal I was doing something meaningful and it'd be worth it in the end to keep fighting every day, as cheesy as that is. I feel like absolute garbage having lost that excitement after working so hard to nurture it and work with my therapist. It just feels like nothing is worth it. I realize it's naive to think things would go my way and for making plans and expecting them to work, but at the same time how do you stave off depression without that? 

In order to be stable and hopefully be able to support my mother I'm going into nursing. I love the sciences and this happens to be another interest of mine. Even though I like it I can't manage to make myself as excited for it. It feels as though I'm a coward for abandoning what I ""truly love"" even though it's completely logical. I'm starting work as a nurse assistant on the 10th. Starting associates degree in nursing in the fall. Pay is very good where I live for rn's so I know it would be enough to leave my mother with everything she needs to be comfortable. I know I'll survive, but I cannot find a reason why to even suffer through that in the first place. Especially when everything feels like a chore and difficult, happy times don't seem to be enough.

Today I didn't even have that bad a day. In fact, my mother and I went out for coffee and had a great time laughing and chatting while taking a walk in the sunshine. But at the end of the day even that joy, which felt like the most I'm capable of, isn't enough to sustain me living. All I can think about is ending it but I can't put my mother through that right after my father's passing.

I have to find somewhere to sit down everywhere I go, I have to walk with a mobility aid, I have to carry a “self care” kit (full of deep heat and other crap I’d rather not carry), I forget how to spell words (I’m a fucking law grad for fuck sake). I’m tired all the time. 

“Learn relaxation techniques”
“Pace yourself”
“Rest when you need to”

I don’t want to. I don’t want to pace myself. I don’t want to rest. I don’t want to wear Skechers. I want to get on with it. I want to get shit done. I want to get dressed up and go out instead of being in bed at 9. I hate this body. I don’t want to accept this the way it is. 

I tried joining support communities but people in them are completely fucking unhinged and say the weirdest shit. Nobody understands how this illness has made me want to just top myself. I’m so sick of being like this.

I am just typing with almost no plan I guess. I have these episodes of not necessarily being okay but more like just good enough and then eventually I go into this huge downward spiral. That is where I am at now. I feel so numb tonight and idk what to do. After every Hyper fixation I get, shortly follows this horrible downward spiral. Now with each spiral I get, it is getting harder and harder to fight this fight. Idk how long these episodes last and that terrifies me. I have to smoke weed at night JUST so i can get sleep. That way I force myself to go to bed so I don't have to deal with my bad thoughts.

And don't get me wrong, I go to therapy, my marriage is going well, yet I still feel so much pain. My wife helps the best she can I truly appreciate that from her. And I could not tell her this but when I am hurting it doesn't help like I wish it does. I just feel like I need to post this because I need to know I am not the only one. I cant be and I just don't know what to do anymore and I am so mad at myself for feeling this way during these episodes, it makes me want to hurt myself and that, in turn, makes me more mad..

I once heard suicide being described as a “rehearsal that went too far.” I have been depressed for a very long time, but my suicidal thoughts are fairly recent - only around one and a half years old. But I could never imagine myself self-harming or actually trying to *act out* on these feelings.

Nobody ever mentions how terribly *painful* it actually is! For some time afterward, my arm was sore, red, and really uncomfortable. My mental pains, however, were far greater and I didn’t immediately stop. Eventually, though, my emotions overwhelmed me and I silently broke down.

I don’t really know how I should feel about this. A part of me is terrified and ashamed, while another part feels … almost relieved?

I’m only making this post because it is *so* hard to keep this all to myself, and I have nobody else who will listen to me. Why not see what other like-minded individuals have to say?

394,An answer,3,1294dt0,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1294dt0/an_answer/,0,"(This is a vent post about one of my previous attempts. I write when I can't talk about my feelings. The thoughts are bad tonight and I need to get this out somewhere. Please don't read this if it's likely to be triggering)

""What the hell were you thinking?"" is one of the most common questions I'm asked when I say I've attempted suicide. Here's my attempt at answer. This is a rough recount of what went through my head before, during and immediately after one of the times I tried to kill myself.

It had been a bad day at work. A bad day, in a shitty week, amongst a few difficult months, on a background of a crappy life. I was approached by a coworker about some private information I hadn't wanted the people I worked with to know, it bought up unwanted feelings. My medication wasn't working right, I had been fighting with my now ex-girlfriend, I was depressed, and I had problems I saw no way out of. I couldn't deal with the idea of another sixty years of this on loop. I couldn't even face the idea of waking up the next morning.

I texted my girlfriend. I spoke to my mum. I tried to deal with my emotions in the healthy way I'd be instructed to in therapy. I went through the motions.

It didn't work.

So I decided to give up and kill myself.

It was that simple.

I waited a few hours. I played music. I paced around my flat. I tried to calm myself down, in the hope I'd either feel better and the ideation would return to passive background noise, or that I'd muster up the courage to off myself.

The latter came before the former. My mum was sleeping now. I filled up a flask with alcohol, grabbed a packet of sleeping pills and all my anti-anxiety meds, then went down to the beach. I hoped that pills and drink would cause my blood pressure and heart rate to drop lower than if I had taken the anti-anxiety meds alone. I went to the beach because I wanted to see the sea for the last time.

I sat down on a bench, thought about what I was going to do, considered making a few phones calls (I can't remember if I did or didn't), then downed all my medication. 

I watched, waitng for the fear to kick in, for the ""what the fuck have I just done"" to start. I felt nothing but relief at the thought that this was it, life was finally over. No more autism. No more anxiety. No more depression. No more stress. No more failures. In a few hours, none of that would be my problem anymore. It was the happiest I had felt in months.

Then I saw a young couple walking down the beach, and I thought about the logistics of what I was doing.

I did a bit of googling, checked the lethal amount of the drugs I'd ingested, and realised I was likely going to survive this. I would wake up tomorrow outside in the middle of December in Scotland, probably with frost bite. If I did die, I'd be traumatising whichever random stranger found me washed up in the morning.

Shit. That was not how I imagined this going.

I wasn't sure how I'd imagined this going.

I considered walking out into the sea and drowning myself, but I decided it was unlikely to be successful. There was too high a risk of dragging someone else into my bullshit: someone might come into the water to try and save me.

I tried to stand up. My legs were going out from under me. The combination of alcohol, blockers and the bitter cold had left my extremities numb and my coordination fuzzy. 

I tried to walk. I failed. I sat back down.

I realised I was going to have to call someone.

Mum? No. I couldn't face that right now, and she'd be sleeping.

Girlfriend? No, for so many reasons.

Samaritans? No, they would take too long to answer and I wasn't sure how much longer I could keep myself aware.

NHS non-emergency? Same problem as above.

It would have to be 999.

I dialed. The phone rang. I hung up.

I sat. I waited. I thought.

I dialed. The phone rang. What was I thinking? This wasn't an emergency. I was fine. It was all fine. I hung up.

I sat. I waited. I thought.

I repeated the ritual.

I do some more sitting, some more waiting, some more thinking.

I dial again. The phones rings. Someone picks up. I explain how I've just overdosed, I'm suicidal, it's not really an emergency. It's all okay. I probably should be picked up by someone though. The voice asks if I want the police, fire, or ambulance service. I hang up.

Ten minutes or so pass. I think of my mother. I think of my friends. I think of whichever stranger is going to find me tomorrow blue from the cold and half dead.

I dial again. This time I stay on the line. I say I probably want an ambulance. I explain how I have overdosed, what I've taken, I'm suicidal, it's not an emergency, don't rush, and that I'm sorry I'm bothering people. I try to explain where I am. I am told to stay on the line. I put the phone down.

I think I try dialing again, but it's hazy from here on our.

I briefly wonder if I'm really as calm as I feel, or if it's just the *redacted* blocking any kind of panic response. I'm probably just being dramatic. It doesn't matter if I die here, and I'm almost certainly going to be fine. I'm wasting everyone's time. Precious time and resources. All that good stuff.

I don't want to go to the hospital. I don't want to be put in a little room with flashing lights and beeping machines and to have needles stuck in my arms. I don't want to deal with the consequences of surviving a suicide attempt. If I'm not going to die, I want to go home.

I start walking up the promenade, maybe I'll fall, hit my head and bleed to death. That would be nice.

The police arrive. I'm loaded into the back of a car. I'm asked questions. Apparently someone told them I was high on cocaine. I talk. I can't remember what I'm saying. I'm taken to the hospital.

My mother shows up. I'm upset to see her. I watch as they put a blood pressure monitor on my arm. It keeps trying over and over to get a reading, but it can't because the pressure is so low it registers it as an error. I sleep for a few hours. The next day I speak to the mental health team. They decide I am low risk, unlikely to die, safe to go home. I am discharged.

to trust people with your life. It saddens me that the only reason why they never gave up on living is because they have children to live for. Children they had with the wrong people.

But I just can't keep pretending like my life is even somewhat OK. There's nothing about this life that is fun or enjoyable. There's nothing about my future that isn't bleak and depressing. There's nothing about me that isn't boring, annoying, or just downright *sad.* I'm just a pathetic worm. The only reason I'm still alive is because I know ceasing to exist will hurt my parents more than I can possibly fathom. But I'm beyond caring at this point.  

Everything in my life is stressful. Work is stressful. Home is stressful. *Existing* is stressful. There hasn't been a moment this entire *year* where I wasn't stressed. If I'm awake and not in bed, I'm stressed out and anxious. Even when I'm in bed it doesn't go away, sometimes.  

I have no goals, dreams, aspirations, desires. No fun hobbies or exciting plans. Nothing to look forward to. Video games are no longer fun or interesting, TV shows and movies are all the fucking same, and I can't read a book for more than 5 minutes without my mind wandering back to my miserable existence.  

Drugs don't help (prescription or recreation). Therapist after therapist has tried to help me by changing my mindset, deconstructing my negative self-talk, creating positive habits like dieting and exercising - none of it ever fucking sticks or helps in the slightest.  

I'm 31 years old. I've felt this way since I was 9. I've given it everything I have. I've tried every fucking possible avenue of self-improvement I've ever heard of or been advised about. Nothing has worked.  

My only ""goal"" has been to enter into a relationship. But you need to be a functional human being in order to have a partner. Partnerships/relationships are about sharing your life with someone, after all - and how do you do that if you don't have one to begin with? No one deserves to be stuck in a relationship with someone like me. So my only real desire in life is impossible...why fucking bother?  

So, I'm gonna go watch the new DnD movie tomorrow, eat at a nice restaurant, try to look as miserable as possible to maybe get a bit of sympathy from the waitstaff, and then off myself. Don't worry, I'll call 911 right before, so no one who is unprepared has to ""find me"". My only regret is this final act will be the worst thing I ever do, as it will harm my parents in unspeakable ways, and leave my coworker in a fucking awful position. But I'm done putting other people before myself. And when I'm dead, I won't be around to give a flying fuck.",1680316154.0

I'm having a very rough time. I lie to people around me that I'm doing fine, that I have a lot of friends. Truth is I don't, I have only 1 friend and I'm just a backup plan for him. I cry myself to sleep every night because I feel so lonely and depressed...

I'm getting bullied, beaten and name-called by people on an almost daily base, I lost my now ex-girlfriend 4 years ago due to suicide. She got sexually assaulted, bullied and beaten. I have a hard time processing all this. 1 month after she passed away I did my 1st suicide attempt. Waking up in a hospital, plugged to machines all by myself... 

My dad is an alcoholic addict until recently and he frequently beat me and my brother up. As till today my parents are most proud of my brother, smarter, happier in life. My other family members told me I should suck it up and that I'm not having it as hard as others...

I walked away from home when I was 18, living on the streets, no where to sleep, nothing to eat for near a month. Just to come back after a while to the same horrible place called ""home""...

I have went to many psychologists, none of them were helpful. I had 1 new psychologist every 3 weeks and every time I had to tell my story over and over until I got tired of it. I have sucked it all up and keep it all to myself. I feel miserable at home, it feels like living in a prison, every minute I spend at home makes it more and more worse...

I have helped so many people in my life, listening to their problems, doing volunteer work for elderly people. People ask me how I'm doing just to be polite. I'm telling everyone I'm doing fine because once I tell them how I'm actually doing they don't care. No one seems to understand the pain I'm going through right now...

After telling some people how I was doing and telling them I'm gonna do a 2nd suicide attempt, they were laughing cuz thought I was joking. The only reason I didn't succeed was because the police stopped me right before I could do it...

I'm struggling to find my own identity, when I look around everyone seems to have found theirs, almost as I will never find who I really am...

I'm having 0 motivation, am always tired of pretending I'm doing okay. 80% of suicides are man, and I'm feeling sooner or later I will be another number to that %. The odds are against me and everyone think because I'm a man that I just have to deal with it...

I'm self-conscious about my looks, I am feeling so ugly and so many people have pointed it out that I think it's the main reason why I'm so lonely. I moved to another country when I was 5 and that was also when the bullying started, I'm getting judged by people for my looks rather then my personality...

My birthday is coming up in 1 month but I haven't celebrated it in I don't even know how many years. No one celebrated me in the last couple of years, no one talked to or did something special...


I want to write this story because I feel like I won't be walking on earth for very long. I don't know how long I can pretend to act like I'm doing fine. I have so many dreams, but it seems like it will never happen. I'm so unlucky with everything that I don't know what happiness is like. I am looking for ways to to a 3rd and final suicide attempt but for now I'm to much of a coward to actually continue doing it. I'm in an constant battle between myself and my demons.

I can no longer afford therapy, and nobody I try to talk to about this fucking cares. 

Like many others here, I am extremely depressed and feel as though the only way to alleviate this misery is by suicide. Two years ago, I had a doctor talk me into a medical treatment which he assured me had minimal risks. I made the life-ruining decision to trust him, and long story short I am now afflicted with a chronic pain condition that stops me from doing many things I liked doing before. I will never forget the smirk on my doctor's face when I tried to tell him that the pain after the treatment wasn't going away. He, and many other doctors told me that the pain was imaginary and that I was having psychosomatic illness. I even had a doctor raise his voice at me and call me a lunatic, because my condition is hard to prove in terms of providing findings on scans and whatnot. The condition itself is very rare, especially for the gender of people that I fall under. As a result, there is little research on the matter, and even fewer medical professionals that even have a remote idea of what the ailment is. I can understand if the doctors accusing me of lying for attention didn't know about my condition, but it certainly didn't help how disrespectfully they treated me. I have spent so much money trying to treat and fix this issue that I had to move back in with my parents, who I have had to start relying on for financial support as the medical bills have taken much of what I have. They were more than happy to help, but seeing how my condition isn't really getting cured but only being temporarily alleviated with these insanely expensive treatments, they are losing their patience with me and my abundant needs. Not only is my quality of life completely fallen apart as I can no longer do physical activities that I loved doing, I live every day in significant pain and spend multiple hours a day trying to resolve the pain by certain treatments and exercises that, while temporarily make the pain go away, it always comes back. I was on a forum for people with my condition, and I could not tell you how many of them committed suicide, or at least announced that they were committing suicide as their final post. They did so because they couldn't find answers for their condition, and they too had doctors accost them instead of trying to help, or at the very least admit they had no idea what to do. Chronic pain completely destroys lives, and it is even worse when you spend countless amounts of money seeing doctors that either tell you that your problems are imaginary, and those who actually are intelligent enough to try to help you can only do so much. 

I want to kill myself. With all of the money I am spending just to prolong a rather miserable life, I don't see why I shouldn't just end things now. What has been keeping me around is the fact that I don't want to die. I loved my life before this hell took it over. I had fun hobbies, a decent job, friends, and an SO that treated me like royalty. I've lost or am on the verge of losing those first three things. My SO has tried to be supportive, but it is very obvious that they too are getting sick of having to help take care of a mopey and depressed person who has pretty much become the antithesis of the person they fell in love with. I would even say there are times when I hope that they will break up with me so that I have one less reason not to kill myself. I love them so much, and I want them to be with someone who enriches their life. Not some miserable asshole who sucks the joy and fun out of everything because they are in constant intense pain because they trusted a piece of shit doctor. I am tired of throwing my and my family's money away. I really don't want to commit suicide, but I don't know how much longer I can live the illusion that I really have a choice. I am slowly losing the support of all of the people I had behind me as they themselves slowly realize that my condition isn't improving. The doctors I am currently seeing are telling me that there may be hope for my ailment to be cured, but we won't know for a long time as we have to see how I respond to treatment. Sometimes I don't know if I want to hold out for an indeterminate time to see if the thousands of dollars of money, that some of which isn't even my own, will have been worth it or would have been a waste. I am so fucking sick of this pain and having to plan my life around it. 

I had such a great life. I was on an upwards trajectory. But now it is all falling apart, and so am I. All I do these days is suck up money and joy and defecate depression. I can understand why the people around me are getting sick of me. I just love them so much and am holding onto the hope that I can return to the person they loved, but with each day that hope is slowly dissipating. 

With all of that having been said, I am appreciative that you were willing to read this far. I commend and thank you for listening to my story, because nobody else wants to hear it. The fact that you do means a lot to me, even if I am not able to know whether or not you read it. I apologize for the lack of detail regarding the description of my condition as well as other aspects of this rant. As miserable as I am, I would hate for someone with my condition to find this post and feel discouraged. On the forum I mentioned before, lots of people posted discouraging things regarding the condition and it resulted in me delaying treatment, which only made my odds of recovery even worse. I don't want to have that effect on others.

I am wishing the very best for the other people in this subreddit with all of the intense struggles they are being forced to endure like myself.",1680396791.0

Recently broke up with my fiance, wont go too much into the why. It just wasnt a very reciprocal relationship. 

But now im 29, faced with the prospect of starting over, knowing full well that I may never find someone again, and it terrifies me. The next 40 years of being alone scares me more than absolutely anything on this planet, and its not something I can bare, i dont think. Im so scared. I just want someone to hold, to hold me back, and to think I may never ever have that makes me want to put a bullet in my head. I dodged that loneliness for 2 years and it all came back so quickly.

I know im still grieving this relationship. I loved her a lot. I dont know if the feeling was mutual. But my suicidal thoughts come in waves. Some days I feel like I can survive this, other days like today (or tonight, really) I just want to die so badly. I dont want to go through life alone, i cant do it.

I worked out, found passions, tried to pursue them, took care of myself, moved to another continent, but now it feels like Im just fit with a good taste in clothing, cultivated, but im an empty shell

I’ve always struggled and it’s always been an effort to meet new people and very very rarely I feel a spark, but it’s too rare and takes too much of an effort

After going on countless first dates, having had multiple friend groups, I know I have good conversation material but I lack the « thing » : maybe it’s being funny, idk

My reward mechanism does not work, each slight negative feeling puts me in an endless loop and my brain learns to never take that risk again

I have never had a romantic relationship, just 1 night stands and sometimes more but I did not really feel it

Lately my financial, professional and social situation went downhill vey fast and that amplified everything 

Yesterday I went to a nice date, good convo and all but judging by her texting today I know there was again no spark. She has mental issues similar to mine and felt like she genuinely liked my concern

But again, no spark. After all this time, I have hope that I will find a job etc. but I will not change who I am, awkward with people. I have lost every last bit of hope for this

How can I have the social energy that will draw people towards me if my brain never rewards me for anything. My brain chemistry is fucked

Why even bother living if it’s a constant struggle, after all the efforts I made it feels like im at the end if the runway and there is still no pilot … Every day I wake up praying that a stage IV cancer takes my life so my family is not affected the same way they would be if I took my own life",1680395833.0

TLDR: I'm mad in love with my gf but I need to leave her but I don't want to and I can't. I feel trapped and she can't see her toxicity. I'd rather kill myself or go to the psych ward than break up with her. she has an absurd amount of men after her and they're probably wishing my worst. I don't wanna see her with someone else. I won't find another girl, let alone one like her. I want another goth girlfriend. I felt miserable before her and I'll feel worse without her.

I know what I have to do but I don't want to nor can I. before we started dating I knew what I was getting myself into, I knew it wouldn't last but I gave her a chance. part of the reason I did that is because I'm an adult that has never experienced love, only heart breaks, manipulation, rejection and fear of trying. the other part is because I was genuinely into her and she ticks all the traits I could ask for a girl, but as everything in my life, no happiness comes without consequences, no happiness comes without deception or failure later. no happiness lasts.

it's my first time dating (we're long distance), I'm a virgin, never kissed anyone, never held hands, never went out on a date, never had my feelings reciprocated, and I'm not even ugly or toxic, I'm just shy and introverted, depressed and socially anxious and I guess my standards are too alien for my generation. I don't like meaningless hookups, I didn't and wouldn't kiss someone I don't love, if I'm gonna have anything with a girl I need to meet her first and have her reciprocate me. now imagine a failure of a person like this, depressed because he is lonely and barely interacts with girls, and then suddenly a girl pops up in his life and shows interest and treats him like no other person has and makes him feel like a human again. would you blame me? I don't. I knew she wasn't the ideal person for me because she's toxic and has a lot of issues that can't be dealt with, she's the impersonation of mess. I knew I shouldn't ignore her dozens of red flags but love is my weakness. nothing good could've come out of it but I'm also a mess of a person and I can't say no to a girl that looks like a legendary card of 1 in a trillion lives (I'm not white so finding a goth girl that wants to date me is hard, I doubt that will happen again).

she's probably narcissistic or very close to it but she's very clingy and dependent on me, she chases me every day, I'm clingy too but not that much so I find this attractive. the problem with her is that she doesn't listen to me and she doesn't understand me, she thinks I don't understand her. I've always supported her when she was down or having a breakdown, you could say we were love bombing each other, but I don't have toxic intentions. she's insensitive with my feelings and she tries to excuse that because she's a sociopath. I never wanted to help someone so much and she does this to me. yesterday I was at my lowest, I cut myself and told her, she threatened to break up with me if I do it again (bluff) and I told her I never treated her like this and was respectful with her when she talked about her problems and when it's me she sees it as overreacting. every time I say something like ""why are you doing this to me, I didn't do this to you"" and ""why are you mad at me for doing the same you did"" she says she's different, as if my issues are meaningless compared to hers. I was trying to drag this relationship as far as I could, I was feeling bad frequently but she also made me feel good and special, it's manageable for me, but after what she said to me yesterday broke me to pieces. she crossed the line, there's no amount of ""it is what it is"" that can keep me in this relationship with her. today I talked to her about yesterday and again she didn't understand me, said she didn't mean it about breaking up, was just trying to help but she didn't even apologize, she really thinks she did nothing wrong and she gets mad at me when I try to show her what she did was wrong and that she doesn't love me for real. I'm not very interested in talking to her after yesterday and she noticed it. like I said she's very clingy and she wants to talk to me all the time (and I'm fine with it, I feel the same) and she understood that as me treating her bad (ironic) and that I shouldn't treat her like that, if I was gonna treat her like that I'm better break up. she's playing the victim. after that I'm more convinced that she's narcissist because besides that she's starved for attention and that's also one of the reasons I feel bad and jealous and she doesn't care. but at least she isn't the type that ghosts me when she's mad or takes shit out on me and is rude for no reason. that's one of the reasons I haven't fallen out of love with her. she says she loves me and does a lot for me but honestly, that's not love, that's obsession.

the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I don't have the means to have a peaceful death, all the methods I have are not worth the pain. I don't know much about meds and I don't have experience with faking receipts. I wish I had the freedom to buy a gun and end this pain.",1680390348.0

Coronavirus pandemic stroke the world and everything was suddenly gone. Before the pandemic I was a student who was really eager to learn and did my best at tests and got good grades, further more I started doing Fitness at the gym and became ""fit"". Which I was not really that muscular nor was I fat or skinny. I was pretty fine living life. Soon after I started learning Japanese (begin 2020) and it was lots of fun. But then the pandemic stroke, where I lost almost all social contact. i only had contact via discord with friends but still it was really strange to me. Also the lack of change in environmen made me get really tired and gave me less motivation (will) to do anything through the day. Later in the summer I started working at a McDonald's in town to get some money to have for later in Uni. But I've gained 10kg and had a bit of a bad year so was not so fit in general.

Next school year the lockdown sorta stopped so I returned quite fast to my old habits. But before picking up the old was complete a next lockdown hit and it really screwed with my will to try anything. As soon as I was doing good something this big smites my life down and pins me to the ground, making me fat, lonely and all. Furthermore I got bad news, a close relative got a really bad case of lung cancer, and she fought for her life for quite some time, this also became the topic most of the diners at the family table (out of concern for our close relative)

In this second lockdown it happened that my mom got the virus for the first time. Before, my parents were always minisculing corona and its effects, they did not believe that for them there was any danger. But yeah we needed to go in lockdown. The worst part is that the day I was finally allowed going back to school My mom got diagnosed: so no school. I was sad and that was visible. My parents had none of it and they suddenly barged screaming and crying into my room that I am such a bad person not caring at all about my mother, that they are done with me etc. This happened out of nowhere and it really shocked me and made me even sadder and completely obliterated my self worth. With tears in my eyes I went on that day doing my homework. 

(I've never got an apology from this, they just decided to attack me verbally because I was bummed about school and then did not feel any danger from the corona case In my household. All the false accusations and slurs I've gone through in that made me (who already was socially deprived of any positive contact) broken. Since then my bond hasn't become any better (they act Asif nothing happened) and I can't really forget it.

Lockdown 2 over.
So the summer came and I got my first real ""big time"" crush. I went to the gym for 2 months lost 10 kg in those months. I was picking up things again due to the crush I was having. She really motivated me. We became friends and one Sunday I went to the capital with a group of friends just to chill there. Later in the evening I get a call (I was 3hours away from home (17years old)), and I got to hear from my parents I must now come home due to an incident. Hours later I came home and was met only by my older brother. As I asumed It was my relative who passed away. My parents left immediately to go to my uncle. But my brother needed to go to study the next day and he lives in dorms. So I was alone. (I didn't get to really proces the loss of a close relative). I tried moving through it and Furthermore asked the girl I liked out. She declined but not knowing I wanted a ""date"" next day she tould me all about a guy she met at a party and how much she likes him
(That one really hurt). This went on for a month till I just told her I really liked her and we parted ways.

Now the summer has ended and my exam year begins
Not a few weeks into my exam year I get diagnosed with hidradenitis (chronic diseases in the skin armpits. It gets chronically infected so abscess are created under my skin in the size of a golf ball.) This disease really hurts and gives me limitations in moving and sports. So I gained fat (again (third time)). The pain stopped me getting a good night sleep and I got anti biotics for Everyday use to mild the infection (only made the frequency of the abscess less , but still 1,5 week infection with max 1,5 week rest and then again infection breaks any attempt at sleeping and fitness habits. I failed many courses and came in trouble at school. My parents did not want to listen do they accused gaming to be the devil in this situation, so wanting to avoid a extreme fight due to their lack of empathy I sold my computer that I assembled and payed of myself. I struggled but got back with school and graduated.

First year uni
In short, hidradenitis became worse, the antibiotics began to show really bad side affects (daily intense stomach aches). So I needed to stop due to failing courses and missing 2 months of the second period due to recovery of the treatment (manual removal of skin in armpits (hurted like hell) got no painkillers that worked, I needed to rinse the wound with water twice a day so the stream of water made me almost pass out from the pain). The scar is as big as my hand so it took also a long time to recover.

But, now what, I came to the realisation that I was just doing what I saw placed in front of me. But now I have a pause year for studies, I am seeing that I have not felt any long-term happiness for the past few years. In a few days I will be 19 and I feel that I have nothing. 

If I look at what I want then there is nothing, I don't have any passion left. Why am I doing this? All this shit, and happiness nowhere in sight. Everytime I try to do something to distract like gaming or going out with friends, I just get the feeling of emptyness, I have fun but don't really enjoy. Like a joke makes you laugh for a moment but then there is nothing. Like what should I do for my birthday? Drink alcohol for what? i don't enjoy that. Play games with friends? I also don't feel anything with that.


So in short I don't have anything I want to do and I can't seem to find something to try new.

I rejected an early birthday present from my brother, because I felt like that his money should not have been spend on me. I didn't feel anything getting the gift. But rejecting it made me feel worse. I just rejected something he did his best for finding for me, to make me happy. And I regret it with every fiber of my body. I feel shit Asif I slapped a birthday cake for me someone spend his entire week making to the ground, because I do not appreciate myself getting anything.

It feels like I won't allow myself even to be happy or to do something I enjoy. Just due to me rejecting everything nice and happy as a reflex (without any thoughts or will)

Without getting to feel something positive and just only feel nothing or just having disgust for my self: what's the point? Why should I proceed if it never gets better? Why wake up tomorrow? For nothing in return?",1680390314.0

Been the family disappointment since the beginning of my life. Accidental birth, didn’t talk until 5 and picked to live with my granny when my mom died. My dads side just looks down on me and I can’t take it. Just a family full of engineers, doctors and lawyers and I could never compete. All my life I’ve been chasing their validation and I think i’ll never get it.


Freshmen year my GPA was 2.7 and I feel like my life is over. Sophomore year I had a 3.6 GPA and now I have a 3.5 GPA but it’s too late for me. Can’t change the fact my GPA is in hell because of freshman year. I wanted to be an engineer so badly but every college I look into doesn’t want me. My dad works at Columbia and everyone expects me to go there but realistically I could never. I’m really trying but I can’t take it anymore. 


Got into an early college program, i’m in symphony orchestra and i’m doing some CS stuff but what’s the point. I studied for fucking 6 hours for my APUSH exam just to get a B, I needed a A so badly but even when I put my everything into something it’s not enough.

Since 2 weeks I am at a point where I know all hope is lost and I am determined to end it. Tried last week but bitched out at the last moment. I have written letters to my family and have made peace with that decision. I am not afraid and somehow really looking forward to be gone. 

I lived a beautiful life so far. Had a great childhood, parents that love me. I am having a good job. So why? I think no one will understand my decision but tbh I dont care. 4 years ago I met the love of my life. I had the most beautiful relationship one can have, full of happiness, support and love. Last year I prepared everything to propose. Because I was 100% sure she was my soulmate. Then 8 months ago we got into some trouble and couldn’t really speak about our feelings. I got drunk and thought I was being cheated on and said the worst possible things to the woman I love with all my heart. 
After I just wanted to make things right again, but I never ever got the chance because she disappeared from my life. She blocked me everywhere and never gave us a second chance. I gave her some space. When I realized its over, I just wanted to have a last conversation with her, to say how sorry I am and to say goodbye to her one last time. But I never got a reaction.
2 weeks ago I wrote her a letter, telling about my depressions, that I can’t move on with my life because I never got the chance to talk to her. All what is important to me disappeared out of nowhere. I feel like I am in a nightmare and hoping to wake up. Just to get the chance to finish our story, and to say goodbye to her one final time. I think this would have shown me, that although it’s over, the love was real and the moments were beautiful once. That I am not even worth a goodbye, shows me it was all a lie. And thats what is killing me.
She was everthing that was ever really important to me, I would have died for her.
I never got a reply from my last message. That shows me even when I will end my life, she wouldn’t care. So those 4 years I lived in an illusion.

What is the meaning of life? Is there a God? Why is there evil in the world? What happens after death?

For myself I too have sought to understand these things. Understanding the nature of things may be best served by looking for the simplest underlying foundational nature of things. 

I offer for your consideration these simplest observations.

**Initial Statement 1:** **Usually the simplest answer is the best.** When there are unknowns and we strive to arrive at a most likely answer, generally speaking that final answer is not complicated. It may require a new way of looking at things, or it may be hard to achieve, but it is not, generally speaking, all that complicated. 

**Initial Statement 2:** **Questioning, observation and understanding** need to be done by the individual internally and in a life changing manner. Only reading the words and parroting back ideas of others for appearance sake is not true growth. It must be made a real expression of yourself.

**Initial Statement 3: Life is a universal force**, just like any other observed force that science currently accepts as truth. This can be seen in what I will call “The Event horizon of life”. 

**Initial Statement 4: Humans, as all forms of life, are creatures of nature.** We are meant to observe our environment be aware of the world around us. Able to see and be aware of that present and real physical world as well as to understand why that world behaves as it does.

**Initial Statement 5: Growth can be difficult,** all of us come from varied backgrounds and experiences, for some the journey may be difficult, yet it may be the most necessary and rewarding effort we can engage in.

**Initial Statement 6: Individuality** is the fundamental expression of life as we currently see it in our world.

· Our endeavors as humans should seek to nurture our individuality as well as all of life in any of its many forms.

· If we awaken the spirit of life within us, nurture its growth, it will find its way to full and complete expression.

· We must embrace our natural being and all that follows while striving to nurture what we can.

**Initial Statement 7: We cannot see the far distant future** of the cosmos just as we can only speculate as to its true beginning. This does not matter. We can only observe what we can now and under the current physical conditions of the world we find ourselves in.

**Initial Statement 8: We as natural living individuals will not survive forever.** We cannot even be absolutely sure as to our retention of a sense of individuality after our earthly life passes. Read on and you will find that this does not matter as we are an expression of the universal force of life. This is who we truly are. We may be unique individuals but we are all essentially the same, one no more important than the other. The cosmos cares not for the individual and that does not matter for we are a part of that cosmos as an expression of life.",1680381949.0

I don’t want to be here anymore I tried so hard to push myself through my depression and my countless other issues but every time I make one step of progress I always fall 10 steps back and I have no support system or any financial assistance other than depending on the kindness of others. As great as that sounds I’m a burden to them and I just learned that my mother doesn’t actually care about my well-being and that she only puts up with it bc I was the one who was supposed to be successful and live out her dreams while dragging us out of a bad situation, but that constant pressure stunted on my development as a kid and now that she sees me as “ruined” because of my mental health I mean nothing to her. I stopped doing things out of her validation and prioritized myself for about a month, exercising, taking vitamins, meditating, essentially taking control of my life but because you wouldn’t be able to tell by how I look physically she just started barraging me with insults about how I’m doing nothing with my life and how my SS tendencies are just a threat to make her feel like a bad mother. Keeping that in mind I kept my distance from her because she’s the type of person to immediately express how she really feels about you the second you go against anything she stands for, im not an individual to her I’m a puppet that she knows she can’t control anymore and it drives her insane.

Nonetheless Im not here to be encouraged out of this because I’ve already tried so much and it’s not worth it anymore. If I don’t want to be here and the people who claim to love me don’t want me here either what exactly am I fighting for other than more suffering in the future. I can pretend like if I have a positive mindset that everything will be sunshine snd rainbows (which I tried)but i truly feel like I’m being held captive and my only other option is homelessness since the economy in Canada is only getting worse with time. 

A year ago I found a booklet online of things to get done that practitioners give to their patients that are gonna use M.A.I.D .as much as most of it gave me closure like addressing my beliefs of the afterlife , writing my notes for loved ones, my will, my obituary, getting my assets in order etc, I tried an experiment where I filled everything out when I found it and if I pushed through my pain I’d check back and see my progress over the year. well if anything this year only cemented in my head that everything I felt only got worse and all my efforts to do better were wasted. I’m at a point where I’m just finishing up the last points of my bucket list of leisure things I want to experience first and I feel like I’m almost ready for sure. 

I’m sorry for the huge sob story but the point of the post was how to make this look like an accident outside of the house.

I have no friends I can talk to or hang out with. Everything I do is tightly controlled by my abusive parents. I can't drive, get a job, or move out. I'm only allowed to be subservient and docile. I'm a slave and death is the only freedom from this hell. 

My father told me when I was a kid that he was going to make me wish I was never born. Well, after all he's done to me, my brother, and the family dog, I have to say, he's succeeded. The only reason my mother hasn't left is because he's never physically assaulted her lmao.

It’s been maybe a month and a half since we broke up he is already having sex with someone else and it is his new girlfriend. I said some mean things to him during our relationship that made him feel not good about himself but he was also very abusive and that is why his parents haven’t talked to him in years. He’s probably the most attractive guy I’ve ever seen before so there’s girls trying to talk to him constantly. I just reached out asking for my jacket back and got emotional asking him why he moved on already (I heard though friends) he said “she is someone I never in my dreams thought I would meet I am so happy she is a model, independent, successful, struggled through life and comes from a humble family that isn’t perfect” because he always hated my perfect family. He continued to say that I’m a child (I have severe depression so I live at home sometimes). He sometimes would tell me I’d never be happy again and that no one would want to be with me. He always tells me that since I rely on my parents for emotional support and a roof under my head that I’m a child and a loser. I have herpes and he said “good luck telling the next guy you have herpes”. A guy played me in college and I got it. Someone I liked but didn’t like me back. I’ve been to the psych unit recently and I think about ending my life I’m so miserable.

A little more history:
I cheated on him the first two months of our relationship with my ex and it destroyed him he never got over it. The whole year after that he used dating apps, sexted and gaslit me. I always tried to make up for what I did I never even bat an eye at a guy I felt truly regretful and I hated and still hate myself. We broke up on and off and every time he would have sex multiple girls. I did once while we were broken up. He was in pain from the cheating at the beginning I was in pain from the current cheating but he convinced me everyday that living together was a good idea… we became intertwined. Scary. Dark. My heart is still deeply attached to him. I cry cry cry. I think about suicide regularly worse than those thoughts I just genuinely hate myself and don’t want to be hated so much. We would get in such bad arguments he would scratch me I’d pull his hair he would shove my face into a pillow, put his hand over my mouth. 
His parents don’t talk to him because his last gf accused him of beating her up.
He tells all his new girlfriends she lied. I don’t know what to think he was the most handsome guy I’ve ever been with and had way too much confidence and everyone thinks he’s cool. He’s fun to be around. I miss him.",1680360939.0

Not even out of anger or sadness, more just ""bleh."" Life is too monotonous, and I had a decent one, I didn't really want to extend it. So a month ago I decided to get a bunch of credit cards and live this last month like royalty, and give banks the middle finger while I'm at it.

  


So that's exactly what I did. I went to Disneyland, bought a bunch of tech and gadgets, the whole nine yards. And I did everything I wanted to do the whole month. It was a lot of fun, and really gave me genuine joy. Anyways the month came to an end I was legitimately satisfied with my life. Sure I had regrets, and obviously I wished things turned out differently, but as far as lives go, mine wasn't particularly terrible. I purchased a shotgun and began to make the note. I have people in my life who would be sad if I left, and the purpose of the note was to try as hard as possible for them to realize this is my decision, not out hatred for the world, I was simply tired of everything. Basically I didn't want any one close to me to feel like they had any role in my suicide.

  


This was going good until I addressed my parents. I was trying so hard to find ways to make the event go as smooth as possible. But I couldn't. I stopped writing the note and decided that it wouldn't matter anyways, I'll be dead. But I couldn't stop thinking of my parents faces. I'm okay with ruining my own life, but I can't bring that pain into my parents.

  


So I didn't, and here we are. Even though I certainly went on a spending spree, I somehow didn't rack up unimaginable debt, all this is quite manageable. I'll have to get a new job unfortunately, and get back to the daily grind. I still have mental issues that I really need to speak to someone about.

He was my friend, he lived at my place after being kicked out by his dad. He had wanted to die since middle school, he had tried so many times i was barely shaken when learning he was at the hospital again.
Then he left for the weekend and never came back. All i have now is blood on the train racks, a few pictures from parties and his clothes carefully placed in my wardrobe. 

It's been a year. We had a lot of friends in common, and he was best friend with my boyfriend. Since he died, everyone wants to die. A friend became an alcoholic, she got raped while drunk, she's depressed and has attempted a few times. Another friend was already depressed, now she's falling back into drugs, ending up in the hospital multiple times. I've considered suicide so many times, I've walked up to the train racks and only stopped because I can't bare to make my parents suffer that. My boyfriend is absolutely crushed by his death, he's depressed, unable to keep a job, hasn't been able to feel happiness in a year, he doesn't cry but only has nightmares, he barely cares about the relationship and talks about suicide so often. I'm his biggest support so I had to keep my grieving on hold for a while but a year later it's getting worst.

I've grown a little resentful. He killed himself while hating the whole world i know it. He could have left in peace, that would be easier to grieve. But no, he left hurt, angry, loathing, crying, hating everything and everyone and himself. 

I just want to let you know: people will care if you die. Even the ones you barely still talk to, or the one you got into fights with and cut off. Suicide kills you and others. Now I live on the edge, in fear of the next phone call, in fear of coming home to a dead body. I know I won't be able to grieve my boyfriend, i know I'll kill myself because it is just too hard, too much pain.

I understand my friend. He had been in pain for so long. I asked him if he had ever felt happy he was alive after an attempt and he answered no. I know he wanted it, we all knew it would happen someday. And still no one could be ready for the pain and horror of his death. 

I don't know what else to say. Even if you think you don't matter, yes you do. Even the people you think hate you, they'll be impacted. Everyone cares, and everyone will die. I'm only lucky everyone has failed through the year because i can't do this again.",1680327543.0

I used to try to talk to my loved ones about my suicidal thoughts (at their request) but I can't bear it now. Not only does it not help in any way, but it makes me irrationally angry. I don't realistically expect them to be okay with me dying, but I also can't stand the pep talks anymore. It always goes the same way.

Just postponing the inevitable at this point. Feels more like euthanasia than suicide. I’ve lived pretty long for a worthless mongrel. In 1 week I will be 24 years old and I haven’t progressed at all since I was 18. In fact I have regressed. My last hope is that reincarnation does not exist; it’s my biggest fear now. I think karma exists so whatever hell awaits me after death I will have to accept. I cannot accept the hell I’m currently in. 

“It could be worse.” I hate having my feelings invalidated. I am a functioning insane person, expected to care and to try my best whilst being incapable of doing so. 

“You don’t know what the future has in store.” Neither does anyone else. I’d rather bleed to death of my own volition than be added to the world leaders’ K/D when the ICBMs start flying.

“People care about you.” I don’t buy it anymore. I feel like a clown with a painted-on smile, just acting the Fool while being full of hatred. I’ve been told you are your true self when you are alone. Feels like the positivity I feel when socialising isn’t real, like scripts I’m following. Makes me wonder if it’s the same for the people who ‘care.’ Do they truly care or do they care because they’re supposed to? Like the dichotomy of civil service. Some feel duty-bound while others are simply clocking-in. You only know which when you reap what they sow. They care to the extent of what they can gain and not a millimetre further. I’ve been taken for granted my whole life while being expected to do the opposite just because I exist. I’m truly ungrateful for my life. It’s not like I can bring any of it with me after I’m gone. Why should I cherish anything if it’s all about to cease to exist? The people who supposedly care about me are full of shit. Unconditional love doesn’t exist. I’m an example of someone motivated to do good by guilt rather than some kind of virtue. I know I’m not the only one.

“Your struggles are what make your story amazing.” My story wasn’t supposed to be this way. The editors took away any agency I had over it. We may not be collectively living in the darkest timeline but I am certainly living out mine. Even I, someone with a tendency towards obsession, cannot repeat the same depressing storylines forever. What’s so amazing about it? Am I supposed to be impressed by the fact that I haven’t committed suicide yet when so many others have? Why is struggling to cope the only thing that qualifies my story as “amazing?” It could have been my favourite story but like crabs in a bucket the people closest to me couldn’t let me climb out of this rut, for seeing me succeed made them reflect on their own unwillingness to improve: a reality more unbearable to them than taking me down with them.

This is just a venting rant. Don’t waste your time and energy trying to unpack it. Like I wrote: I had my second chance. There is no way back. I can’t keep going when everywhere I look I see what could have been. Feels like being the subject of constant mockery. I’m the living shadow of a person who doesn’t exist. The light of his love has all but vanished. Soon there will be nothing separating me from nothingness. The bitter juice of the fruits of my labour wasn’t worth being pulped.",1680341071.0

So one day me and her got into a fight I can't remember what it was about but I ended up writing some mean stuff in my diary about her and her family so I could get rid of some of my anger. a couple of months later we were having another fight when she brings up what I said in my diary. I instantly knew that she had read through my diary and it had some heavy emotional stuff of mine in there so naturally, I was upset and from there, our relationship has had a steady decline.

when I was 13 I moved back in with my dad because my mum developed ovarian cancer and couldn't afford to take care of me. it has been nothing but a downhill roll from there. I was only meant to stay a year before going back to live with my mother but I had the decision to either stay with my dad or mum and naturally 13 year old me didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings when one day when my dad wasn't home SM came up to me and demanded I made a decision then and there after only two weeks of thinking about it. she was getting angrier with me by the minute and I decided in a rush to stay with my dad so my mother could get better, she seemed a little annoyed by that and that was that she walked off without a word to cheerfully tell my dad over the phone I made a decision so soon.

I could go on and on about the stuff she has done to me but ill try and summarize it. she has thrown a box of salt crackers at me, read my dairy again when I was 15, and at a later date made me read the section where I talked about SH just because I was winning the argument and she didn't like it. she has two daughters and constantly gets them things but if I ask my dad he says no, once when I was 15 I asked my dad for a septum piercing practically begged and he said no then when my younger step-sister turned 14 she got a septum piercing that her mum paid for. every time I went without, the excuse my father said was ""they aren't my kids"" but he had no problem buying them things and not me. my dad pressured me to get a job as soon as I could get one then said I wouldn't be able to hold a job for a week, One day my grandmother brought over some cupcakes, some of them had nuts and some didn't, we didn't know if I had a nut allergy at the time so I wasn't able to eat nuts at all until we found out and on that day I had to go to work and my dad promised me one when I got home. when I finally did got home from work everyone had eaten all the nut-free ones but left the nut ones and my dad just said ""oops sorry"" and I had to sit and watch as my SM and step-siblings ate the rest of the cupcakes while I couldn't have any. one of the issues I think I might have is adhd because at the time I had been looking into it for months and decided I should at least get checked so when I sat down with my dad and SM and told them I think I might have this thing and before I could even state my case they started laughing right in my face and kept laughing as I walked away crying. My dad and SM took all of us to darwin for SM's birthday, our birthdays are only a week apart so when we spent a week there celebrating her birthday I thought we would be able to stay a day or so longer for mine but instead they booked the flight back on my birthday because they forgot that day was my birthday and when I got upset they yelled at me and we didn't celebrate it at all 

it wasn't great with my step-siblings either my younger step-sibling always got what I got but never the other way around she liked to bully me a lot by pushing me, calling me names, and excluding me. every time i went to my dad about it he said to fight back but when I did I would get yelled at so I learned to just sit there and take it. when I was 15 I still hadn't gotten my period and when I tried to tell my dad something was wrong he kept saying it was how I ate junk all the time or how I never eat vegetables (which was untrue). finally, when I turned 17 I went to the doctor to find out what was wrong with me and it turns out that for some reason my body just doesn't produce estrogen and I had to go on estrogen tablets to actually experience puberty and now I'm a 19-year-old going through a 16-year-olds puberty and he never apologized for not listening to me.

my dad was or is rarely on my side, he could hear SM cuss at me and say mean things when we fight but he would never step in and help so it was always me against her from when I was 13. when my SM would get mad she would go crazy screaming throwing her hands around stumping and it was very scary for me. it also wouldn't help that I was basically a black sheep in my family because of them, they liked to talk shit about me to them when I was right across from them and could hear. i become paranoid when I was 16 to 17 because they talked behind my back so often that every time my SM would whisper around me I felt in my bones that she was talking about me and the way she whispered made me want to rip my skin off.

That's not even half the stuff they have done but I just wanted to get some of it off my chest because she wants me out of her house and my dad is doing nothing to stop it. I have nowhere to go, only a small amount of savings and to be honest I'm just so tired I don't want to live anymore. it's been a battle my whole life and I'm just so tired so even though no one may read this it's good to get it off my chest before something happens to me, and if you did read all of this.

tw - sh/ sa 

ever since i was 8 years old i wanted to die so badly, though at the time i was being sexually abused by countless people at the time so i guess that would’ve encouraged that thought but right now i’m trapped, my friends are horrible to me, they hang out people i tell them hurt me like this one guy who groped me on the bus when i was 11 they keep talking to him, and i have no one else to go to when they go up to him at school so i just say i need the bathroom and cry there, also my friend told my crush i liked him even though i told her that if he ever rejected me i would kill myself so i would rather not know his response she did it anyway, lucky he didn’t really give out much of a response and just said something irrelevant and ran away embarrassed but that same friend also humiliated me in front of him in role call saying i called him so big he could fit inside of my little sisters suitcase (the suit case was very wide and was probably 4’11 long) when i never said that, all i said was that my sisters suit case is so big a person could fit in there but she made it seem like i was calling him fat. the person i said i’d kill myself over him not liking me due to him being the only thing i live for she decides to say i called him fat. whenever i try hanging out with someone else other then her she gets mad, saying she feels sad that i don’t hang out with her and saying she feels left out and i’m a people pleaser so it’s really hard to stay away from someone and tell them to go away i just usually do whatever people want me to do it’s not something i can handle, also i’m not even safe when o go home my dad has bipolar and he used to not take his pills so he’d scream at me and my sisters, one time he smashed my older sisters phone and threw metal pipes at her at beated her then threw shit down the stairs breaking the window and one time when i was getting back from primary (elementary) school i saw him grab my dog and throw it outside a open door which the dog got his head stuck on the fence and almost choked to death and other shit he did i can’t remember but he takes his pills now just in terrified of him and my mom used to hit me whenever i did something bad but now she just yells at me, i think she still very badly just wants to hit me again because she said she doenst hit me anymore because it illegal and she really tries her hardly to just yell at me for every small tiny thing i do no matter what she will try to yell and ridicule every small thing i do, i can’t move, think, breathe correctly near her it’s gotten to the point where i get genuine heart dropping fear asoon as i hear foot steps coming forming the stairs , anything im doing i just drop it, quickly clean it all up and run to my room and wait for her to go back upstairs . i can’t even go to my grandma because she’s even worse one time i was at her house and i was extremely sick i couldn’t move or eat properly because of how much it hurts my body and my throat especially it hurt way too much i was crying from trying to eat and my grandma udndt care she just said it was all my fault for ruining the trip( i get holidays when i go to my grandmas house because she actually takes me outside unlike my parents) all my grandma did was give me pain killers and let me sleep for hours in her bed not even awake for probably 20 minutes i just slept for the entire day and entire night . i’m safe no where my most safest place is the library or the toilets at my school because in the library and toilets no one bothers me, looks at me, hit me or screams at me there i can be alone without constant stress but atm that’s the only thing i have and i only have 2 more years of school so it’ll be stripped away from me . i don’t know how to get a job no one will help me with it and i don’t understand it. i’m not covid vaccinated either because my mom thinks i’m not worth it and it’s too expensive. my mom also doenst care for a single problem i have i keep telling her i see shadows of people in the corners of my eye or even afew times someone very clearly just with a weird non human face or they disappear when i blink or turn my head away, she thinks i make it up and doenst care she thinks i do it for attention,i hate myself aswell i think i’m extremely ugly i have so many pimples i just want to rip my face off atp  i hate my face i just want to be pretty honestly i jsut want atleast for my crush to like me maybe you know to have just someone to like me but i feel and look too ugly i think . i don’t understand why i can’t have anything i can’t live a day without my friend embarrassing me RIGHT INFRONT OF YHE MAN I WOULD KILL MYSELF OVER I TELL THEM THIS AND THEY JUST DONT FUCKING CAREEE when i told them to stop fucking doing thsi shit and al they did was roll their fucming eyes and give me an annoyed face like what the fuck did i do to deserve this fucking life I JUST WANT TO DIE ALREADY I HATE THIS SHIT WHY CANT I BE FUCKING AHPPY I AHVE YEHDJJHSSVUO

Firstly, around 8 months ago my wife demanded a divorce and took our 2 kids and left back to her home country of Norway. I simped and agreed to it, in hope that she wouldn't do it and let the kids see their dad regularly but she did it anyway. She's a child of divorce so she thought it would be fine for them and me because her dad left her and her mum and she supposedly was fine with it.

Secondly, throughout the past 3 months of being alone, i have been having blackouts while driving at my job (truck driver). Ive also had wierd feelings in my chest, and pains in my arms and shoulders. These happen when i get nervous and i dont know what the triggers are.

Thirdly, i tried to get help for this with the doctor and ive been told to not drive until the root cause has been found and treated. if it is found that i have symptoms of syncope and an irregular heart beat causing not enough blood going to my brain, i will be banned from driving for at least 12 months.

So within less than 1 year i have lost my house, my friends, my wife, my kids, my job, my regular weekly earnings from my job, my licence, my health, and although i had lost my mind since 2014 - it's now so bad i doubt it will ever recover.

Please tell me why any sane person would carry on living like this? I despise it when people say to get up and go to the gym... HOW? i can't even walk outside and be among a stranger walking by without getting sweats and a thumping pain in the chest how the fuck am i gonna go to a gym wearing gym gear be among other men and women and lift fucking weights? its just not possible.

I really just want to jump off a bridge. there is one about 100 miles away from me tall enough to cause death - and some people who have done it in the past at this bridge have all sucessfully died. i want to join the list. and i will. so i dunno why i even wrote this. no one gives a shit. humanity is a disaster species and we should all go hand in hand, and walk into extinction - that's the best thing we could ever do.",1680352973.0

I’ve been in a relationship with a M26 for over 5 years now. We have a 15 month old daughter. When I met him I knew he had anxiety and depression, but I was ok with it since I have some mental issues myself and I think we deserve love too.

We live in my mom’s second apartment, so we don’t have to pay rent (only water, electricity etc). My mom also pays for nursery that our kid attends, so I have time to study and go to school (I’m getting an occupational therapist certificate, one year left). I only work as a summer camp teacher for 3 weeks a year (the paycheck is a joke but I love the job), but I’m still getting child support from my father as long as I’m still learning and am less than 25. 2500 PLN a month, which probably doesn’t seem like a lot for a US citizen (translates to 580$), but here in Poland it’s basically as much as monthly payments for a small apartment. My fiance makes almost thrice as much. 

The problem is, him, being the main profider for our household, he is constantly stressed about losing his job (even though he is a great employee and gets praised by his boss often).

He was in therapy for half a year, in 2020 but he quit, the reason being his disbelief of it working. I let it go, can’t force him after all, right?

For the past 2 years life was good - we got engaged, I got pregnant and our Lilia was born. We fought sometimes and had some mental struggles and meltdowns, but that’s normal. Or so I thought.

See, I attend therapy weekly. I take meds. He does too, but that’s it, he thinks they will fix everything. The fact that he regularly forgets to take them is a different story, tho. I work so hard to get healthy or at least get as well as possible (I have BPD, PTSD, depression, anxiety and eating disorders). I wanna be able to support my family and love myself.

Today I saw him cry for the first time in years. It was about a TikTok of a little girl crying about his dad offing himself. My fiance told me that he wanted to „do it” so many times, because he is so tired and overwhelmed. He can’t see any hope. But as soon as I mention therapy he starts to get pissed and shuts me out. I made him promise to go to therapy, even if it was for me and our kid for now. He reluctantly agreed, but I’m 90% sure he won’t go through with it and his emotions will bottle up overtime and his suicidal thoughts will only get worse. I am really scared for his life. He keeps saying that I deserve someone better and that he only hurts me and Lilia. I tried to explain to him that the mere thought of him disappearing from our lives is what’s devastating and that I want to spend the rest of my life with him, happily. But it went over his head.

I asked him if I could speak to his mom about it, even if I don’t really believe she’ll help since she’s pretty ignorant about mental health. I hope she’d understand how severe the situation is, though. But it doesn’t matter anyway since fiance won’t let me speak to her. He also said that if I want to share it with anyone else, then he won’t tell me anything anymore. I feel so alone in this, I can’t help him on my own. I don’t want to lose him, I love him. Our daughter loves him and needs him.

Never posted before, but thought this would be a good idea. We will see. 

I should be working on my many many assignments right now, but instead, I am here. I feel like throughout my life, I have always had to work twice as hard to get places. I work countless hours on my assignments but still do not get good marks. I try so fucking hard in my life, but I get no where. The fact that I struggle with eating disorders(unfortunately, I have had more than one before and that continues to be the case) and severe depression and suicidal thoughts for years now does not help. Tried fixing that, tried really hard and wow guess what? Didn't work. 

The only reason I have not expired yet is because I do not want to hurt my family. They have believed in me for all my life and they give me so much love.

That is why I do not know what the hell to do. I am a complete failure, and I want to die all the time. But doing that would cause them grief, because they love me so much for some reason. I do not deserve it though. I have not done anything to make them proud. 

I made a compromise with myself though. I give myself until 30. I am still young. I have 8 years to accomplish what I want to in life. If things get better(they never have, but you never know I guess), I will continue until I no longer want to. If they do not, I will kill myself before I hit 30.

I was making an effort job searching for a position that is relatively more calm than my prior emergency department. For me my midshift in the ED would see me doing hardstick, ultrasounds IV, and lining and labbing incoming triage PT who sit in the waiting room for more than an Hour.  This would almost always take me away from my original assignment at start of shift and I have grown tried of it. When I started there I built a reputation of consistently starting IV's on hard sticks and initial it was fun spending the whole shift lining PT's but now some nurses or my fellow tech do not even try. The resource nurse multiple times have held me minutes before clocking out to go do a hardstick on the floors. It was not all bad, as I think this was the best group of coworkers/ management I worked with, but again I wanted to move on from bedside to something more cushiony in prospective of my BSN program.

 I interview with a Call center(bed assignments) with HCA in Florida. I shadowed one of my future coworkers on what I would be essentially doing. Got contacts with my eventual supervisors. All that was left was to do a drug test, Background check, and progress with the remaining onboarding. My start date was April 3rd.

Now after I fully resigned from my ED tech position, and began the Background check process, this is where the whole thing goes to shit and I believe it went to shit due to ""Precheck"" a third party that verifies employment as well as background checks.   A week ago from now I get notified that one of prior employments cannot get verified( I worked as a physician substitute at a donor/ specimen collection blood bank). Whatever number their calling is not patching them to Human resource. So I call multiple times between the blood bank and precheck. First to get the correct extension from the bloodbank then to give it to precheck so they can update it. Essentially the people who work for precheck refused to update the extension to the  HR and the bloodbank refused to call precheck on my behalf to verify my employment. Additionally actual HCA HR was little help in rectifying this afterward even when my assigned representative stated they would override my employment verification as long as I have proof via a W2...

Well I just got a update today that  ""we have denied your application for employment, are not promoting you, are terminating your employment, or are withdrawing your conditional offer of employment.""  I am literally floored. I have never had a problem with HR processing my information and I feel my case was neglected. I communicated the situation as much as possible between all three parties and my manager multiple times last week and the week prior and I am so exhausted mentally. It like the easiest obstacle that they cannot seem to get over.


I feel so sidelined right now. I am a college student living on off-campus housing, am not receiving financial support from anywhere else. I am not close to my family(we do not have a relationship)and I do not really have a support system. I literally went from having a farewell party a couple weeks ago with coworkers to now not having a position lined up, tomorrow is also the day to apply to my BSN program.


The only way I can express how I feel right now, is defeated. I feel like such a disaster right now, my entire plan just fell apart and I feel stuck. Im mainly typing this as an outlet as I do not have anyone close enough to me to speak about this. I felt stable for so long, now this.",1680326581.0

It's been extremely painful to know I broke 5 years of sobriety, and 7 years clean of SH. I want to keep telling myself I'm not sure why but ever since this year started I've felt as if my life is falling apart.
I've decided to switch majors, and there's nothing in this world that could make me regret that but the expectations that have been put on me due to my rapid growth has been intense and become a burden to me.
I've recently gotten my hours almost completely cut at a job I absolutely adored.
Those two things basically consume my whole life. Work and school, and now those things aren't working out, everything else around me is becoming a problem and making my own insecurities more prevalent.

Which leads me to say how much I fucking hate myself. I never really found myself being so hateful until other people are involved, so this pressure from everyone around me, both supportive and unsupportive, has not only been absolutely soul crushing but full of so much self doubt. I feel as if my efforts go unnoticed, I constantly feel as if even though I am doing my very best, it's never fucking enough. 

Is it even worth it to wait around and see if it all will get better? 
Obviously, yes, but when I feel like I can never do anything right, I just wonder if this life is worth living to find out if I actually will eventually.
I'm scared I'm going to stay as this mediocre person my whole life. That I'll forever be stuck in this cycle. I can't even make ends meet right now and it's so fucking hard. I'm scared to be without the things I need but I just don't know how to fix it all without being a bother to the little amount of people in my life. 
Which, I feel like the only thing that is keeping me here are my chinchillas and even now I question if I'm even good enough to them to keep them around like this because I don't think I'm treating them right.

Everything just feels difficult right now and not only all of this but I'm still trying to work through and sort out trauma from abuse I've dealt with for the past almost 2 years.

This all really just scratches the surface of what I feel, being diagnosed with BPD I often deal with depression and other range of negative emotions but I really do feel like it's different this time. This thought of going away forever just lingers around me and no matter how much I ignore it, it just doesn't go away which has caused me to partake in unhealthy behaviors.
I want to improve and get better, I've looked into ways to get help but it's so unattainable for me because finances which is so fucking unfair, but that's just how the world is I guess. That reason alone has lead me to vent here. I know a lot of this seems very minimal but I don't feel like the gritty details of things are important. It's just been very hard on me and I feel very alone in all of this, that's all.",1680325121.0

""I don't know exactly where to start. But, it just started with my psychologist saying not to see each other today since she has a meeting. I was planning alm the week to get to this day.

So I texted and emptied almost all my inboxes (i was not feeling like answering them a long time ago) actually I'm doing nothing but surviving off my gf, since his parents are kind of money people, and I just lay my ""life"" in her help. But today, I just felt like being with someone that isn't my love life is not what i'm standing for in life, i have endured so much of that relationship bc of needingness. Althoug I don't feel like doing anything at all to help me. So I was thinking about ending my relationship with her today, but as the sun sets, I don't feel like that yet.

I landed my dream job last week, and started yesterday. I could not get any sleep Wednesday night, and because I am also a heavy sleeper, I ended up staying awake all night to make sure I was on time to work on my first day… After work all I wanted to do was sleep, but I knew I would wake up at night, and not be able to fall asleep. So in an attempt to have a good night of sleep, I decided to help my friend move into his apt after work. By the time I got back home it was 10pm, and I had been up for 40 some hours, I went to bed, but couldn’t sleep, I tossed and turned for an hour. Eventually at 11pm ish, I got up to drink some warm milk, and take some of my homemade herbal sleep aid. 2 am rolls by and I have work in 6 hours, GREAT. I said screw it, and took a prescription sleep pill I got from my friend….. next thing I know, it’s 5pm and my two sonic boom alarms are still going off, along with my phone alarm. I check my phone and I have two missed calls from my landlord threatening to kick me out due to noice complaints (my alarms) and late rent, along with my brand new boss telling me I’m fired. I need some serious fucking help and I’ve tried everything. I’m not suicidal, but all I want to do is cry, leave my girlfriend, family, and everything behind and go live in the woods. My depression is so bad, I can’t even afford my anti depression medication. Suicide would just end all of my disappointment, embarrassment, and stress. My struggles have effected my family so much, that it’s caused my mom to have a heart attack, and my dads health has worsen since I came to them for help. Obviously I just need to keep on doing what I was before, and act fine to protect them. I’m going to lose my apt, my parents are going to kill me, and it’ll push them to the edge and I’m afraid for their health. I love my girlfriend, but I don’t even care if she loses me or leaves because it’ll be better for her. I am fucked, and in deep shit, idk what to do.

If I don't feel unwell enough I may update how the poison takes its course, however I may miss this window to post since I will be sleeping at and past the 12 hour mark so I may not wake up to update.

As for why....

# Why:

I am not good enough for my dream. I worked really hard to get into a good university so I can become an engineer (materials) so I can make enough money to help people. I also wanted to prove and provide hope for those with mental illness struggling with their dreams and with the question of what them can achieve. I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder type 2, on the autism spectrum and PTSD. I really wanted to help people in my position by showing that they can make their dreams work too but I wasn't good enough for that. I went to a community college to prove it to myself first before I set out with a bigger commitment of a university. I did really well and then got accepted into the Colorado School of Mines. I worked hard but it was always a struggle. Any win I got somewhere was a loss somewhere else. I have read books and done online programs to try to make myself smarter and more disciplined and it certainly helped but it wasn't enough. I have since had to do a hardship withdrawal late in the Fall 2022 semester which locked me out of this semester as well. Not that I was healthy enough to attend if I wasn't locked out. I don't believe I am either healthy enough or smart enough to make it work.

I also never understood people. I have been alone most of my life with long periods of no friends at all. Even in early childhood I had few friends and only saw them every few months. I have tried very hard to improve my social skills and people tell me that I have improved but it still isn't enough. This misunderstanding of people often leads to me crossing boundaries or do other social wrong doings that isolate me. I don't mean to do this but I genuinely don't understand how to do better, I understand that people on the autistic spectrum have trouble socializing but that doesn't make it right.

I have sought professional help many times throughout my life. I must admit that it has helped to a degree but I don't believe it can fix me. I doubt I will ever be strong enough to help others and I doubt  I will ever understand people well enough to have close friends or close relationships that last. I am Christian, although I am largely ignorant of the Bible and have only gone to church when I was healthy and a believer in my life, I have started to believe that God wants me to commit suicide. I know that anybody who knows God better than I would tell me otherwise it just feels that everything in my life has been leading up to this decision like I have been guided to it all my life. I acknowledge that this might just be delusion but it is hard to fight when it seems like so many things have lead me to this choice of suicide. I genuinely believe that I can do more good by committing suicide. I think that I will have a Curt Coban type effect where I am idealized in death so I in a way become a better person for those that knew me. Showing them the importance of taking care of yourself and clinging to what matters most to you in life by showing them an example of when someone fails to do so.

I don't know what I am looking for when posting this. \[Redacted for community rules\]. I also think more likely that I just want someone to talk to that doesn't know me and therefore sound the alarm to get me hospitalized so I can share my final thoughts.

# Time Based Update:

**12:30am:** According to Wikipedia, as soon as 30 mins to 12 hours accounts for the first stage. It was described as becoming drunk-LIKE. I am starting to feel tipsy/drunk-LIKE, it is similar to being drunk but not quite exactly. It is not unpleasant in anyway. I am hoping that it does not progress to the feeling of being too drunk because that is awful. I should also note that I have a very high tolerance for getting drunk. I am not a drinker by any means but I am a 225lb guy who is 28 years old.

**2:00am:** It feel like I am heavily drunk without crossing the line of too drunk. Note I have a high tolerance so this may not be the same for others. It feels like I am on a boat and I involuntarily sway from side to side. I am having trouble keeping a single train of thought and I also find myself rambling to myself. Note this is normal when I get super drunk and am alone. I also played a videogame and had significantly lower reaction time. It would not take a cap or medical professional in order to visibly tell that I have drunk-like symptoms. It is so similar to being drunk that if somebody were to give you this instead of alcohol, you would not be able to tell the different. There are no negative symptoms as of late.

**3:00am:** Coordination is very hard. My breathing is heavy. I am frequently dropping items and having difficulty picking up dropped items. I am also having a significant problems typing. My feeling of being drunk is bordering on being too drunk and being borderline unpleasant. I have significant problems with executive function and I am relying on autocorrect to make sense of my typing plus I am struggling to complete simple tasks. \[Not I had to retype and restructure parts of this sentence a lot to help make sense of it, it is possible it still doesn't make sense. I am too ""drunk"" to help.\] Reading is becoming hard because my sway blurs the words quite a bit paired with my difficulty typing and constructing sentence.

# Emergency!!!:

**3:23am:** I am terrified. I puked up a lot of substance. Not this is at the 4-hour mark so one might assume that my plan would still work but a lot of colored red stuff was present in the vomit. The drink I went to the store to drink was red gatorade. I instantly feel less drunk but I am worried that not a lethal dose was dissolved in my system. I am now faced with the choice of either drinking more and risk vomiting/more suffering or trying to down more to hope to sure up the dose.",1680243489.0
653,I’ve Lost All Motivation to Live,1,128dd4b,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/128dd4b/ive_lost_all_motivation_to_live/,0,"I’ve been stuck in this mindset for many years now. I simply don’t see a scenario where I can live on with genuine happiness. I’m happy when I’m with friends, but that will change soon. See, I’ll be graduating from high school in May, and then I’ll have to say goodbye to my friends for a good while. One is going out of state for work, one is staying in our hometown, one is going into the military, and I’ll be going to college three hours away. I’ve been trying to prepare myself for the sense of isolation I’ll inevitably feel once I’m in college, and it hasn’t been fun.

I feel like I’m expected to live a happy life, and I don’t know how. I turned 18 last Tuesday, and I couldn’t feel excited about my birthday at all. Well, it’s one year closer to death so at least I have that to look forward to.

Living here is hell. I live in the southern part of the United States, and I don’t know if anyone has kept up with the news, but the future in the south has been looking bleak. I’m a woman, a lesbian, and biracial, so the odds are really stacked against me. I developed boobs when I was young, like 13, and I’ve been objectified for them ever since. The worst part is that it was usually by adult men. 

I started self harming when I was 15, and I didn’t know that I would spiral into it being an addiction. I used to slash my thighs, ankles, and on the back of my arms frequently. I’ve been clean since November, but I get urges every single goddamn day. When the urges get strong, I try to remind myself of all the people in my life who love me; namely, my family.

My parents have a lot riding on me being successful, and the same goes for my three younger siblings. Ever since I was made aware of that, I’ve been living with the gigantic pitfall in my stomach. I don’t want to disappoint anyone and I don’t want to cause unnecessary pain either.

I want to stop existing, to just fall asleep forever. I want to cut myself up into mincemeat, even though the euphoric feeling I felt was bad. I want to keep the bonds with people I have because I am so goddamn scared of being alone. To anyone who says “you aren’t alone in this fight,” I don’t want to hear it. I’ve heard that same sentence dozens of time in the past and it’s all honestly just empty words to me at this point.

I can’t be with people forever, because it’s just a fact of life. Choosing to not exist sounds more appealing than college ever has been. The thought of spending eternity floating around in dark matter is what I want most in the world. 

I wish I wasn’t self aware and I wish I didn’t have to start the next phase of my life so soon. I want to die. I want to end everything.",1680329941.0

It's reminded me how, people are fundamentally unable to care. Not because they are evil or mean, but because they're overwhelmed with feeling any responsibility.


I don't think I can take much longer honestly. Therapy simply hasn't been enough. I feel so low literally 6 days a week. I can't suffer alone forever.

I guess I'm curious if anyone found something that helped besides venting to friends, paying for a ton of therapy sessions per week or journaling (doesn't work very well for me)?",1680329871.0
655,This might be long,1,128dc60,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/128dc60/this_might_be_long/,1,"I have had a history of mental health issues from the time I was a child.

I was seen for OCD for compulsive hand washing (to keep clean) at an age so young that I don't know how old I was. This was followed by severe mental health issues as I got slightly older, maybe 10-11, when I became anti-social and started hating existence (might be a factor of age, I really don't know or care). Things did not stay that way, as when I was 14, I made my first real friends freshman year of high school. I did not really fit in but I tried. My friends used very offensive language, specifically the n-word, which I started using around the group, but felt wrong. That was the first sense of belonging I have ever felt, to this day, but I ended up having a mental divergence from them, then I transferred to a local high school that was not as academically rigorous to pursue dual-enrollment classes.

Keep in mind that I did well in school because I test well (multiple choice questions usually have an obvious answer, or you can make a 50/50 guess after ruling two answers out). I always greatly struggled with English and anything that involved critical thinking. I was in Gifted Learning programs at an early age, and learned that I was meant for something great. I was too young to really see any issues with how I was thinking, and all adults around me, esp my parents, failed or didn't want to listen to me as I was clearly having a very hard time.

To add, I was free to explore the internet at a young age. My parents had me at 24 and 25, two months after they got married, and during a crucial time in their lives when they were trying to figure their lives out. Both were busy building careers and establishing their lives, and they did a damn good job. But I began looking at porn before I knew what porn was, which is another issue for another day. I would hate going to school so much that I would watch things like 2 girls, 1 cup before school in the hopes that I would throw up and be able to skip school. Drank piss and shit water to get sick. I hated everything.

Anyway, that is some backstory, for those who read this. As I got older I started to notice things I would do, but only after I did them, and it scared me a lot. The first example was at 16. I lost my head a bit and broke into a laundromat in the middle of the night just because; maybe I could get a couple hundred out of it? Registers don't hold money after close though ( I knew this, being as I had two jobs at the time). The alarm went off in the store, and I ran, then drove my car to a different state 12+hrs away. I came home after a couple days.

When I really lost my head, and why I don't deserve to even ""be helped"" or redeem myself is when I almost really sexually assaulted a girl I really liked. There is no excuse for this behavior than to be horribly sick and I can't believe I walk among normal people after that. But I managed to get and have a loving relationship that truly made me love myself and everyone else for the first time in my life. After three years, I lost my head again and destroyed that relationship.

Then I robbed someone's house, and my negative horrible energy somehow convinced my friend to help. I will never forgive myself for it. I don't deserve forgiveness. I am just a bad person, who actively takes away from others. There are some people that do not deserve kindness or a will to live. I can say that I have never had a will to live, and the persistence of everyone keeping me around has only resulted in destruction.

I'm 25, and time has removed me from those incidents. I am a horrible person, but the only people that I can explain how honestly horrible I am are not the ones worried about me being around. I belong in prison, but I just want to eliminate this curse from affecting anyone every again. My life is a blight on everyone else, so my actions affecting my parents don't hold any weight anymore. Suicide is a community service at this point.",1680329854.0

657,**TW!!!!! EATING DISORDER TALK**I did something that might have ruined my life,1,128cmxf,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/128cmxf/tw_eating_disorder_talki_did_something_that_might/,0,"A bit of background - I have struggled with depression, ADHD, and eating disorders for a big portion of my life, stemming from childhood trauma. My family has always had my back, but even so I seem to be one huge failure.

My parents are really good and smart people. They can handle money relatively well, even though we did not have a lot of it growing up. They saved up enough money for me to go to college and university, in hopes I would have a good career and end up with a good job.  

During high school, i tired really hard to get good grades so I would be able to get into universities and proceed with my dream, to become an Entomologist(the study of insects). It is a high paying job, depending on the field. I love insects and arachnids and wanted to help them in this way. I literally wanted this since I was 5. 

Well, fast forward to college and I began to work on that. That is when my eating disorder hit me. Nothing else mattered, my family, my education, nothing. I barely ate and overexercised to the point where I would faint almost every day, I just could not concentrate anymore. My grades dropped significantly. I received a letter from the Dean, saying that if I do not get my grades up Ill be dropped from the college. I had no choice by to switch majors. Had to switch to philosophy. Something ""easier"". Now, I love philosophy, and those who get careers in it, I envy you. But it is not really meant for me. But here I am years later, still in Philosophy. It was because I am too dumb to do the math portion of my education. 

i know this is probably pretty dramatic, but I feel like i ruined my life by doing this. I am doing something that I do not really want to do, and I hate myself so much because of it. Unfortunately I still am plagued by eating disorders. I feel like my life has no meaning. I have no talents, nothing. And now I am pursuing an education(I know i am lucky to get an education, I wish everyone was so lucky) that i do not think will go anywhere. All I ever wanted to do is make my parents and partner proud, they worked so hard for their educations and welcomed new challenges. They tell me that they are proud of me no matter what but I do not understand why. I have not accomplished anything I wanted in my life, it was taken by depression, anxiety and eating disorders. 

If I die, I will probably only make things worse. And once again, hurting the people I love. But at the same time, i will be at peace. I do not know what to choose.

I'm so scared. I feel like everything is falling apart and I'm trying to hard to be better but nothing is working. I'm only getting worse and I'm so scared I'm going to hurt myself.

I think I'm developing OCD. I have intrusive thoughts all the time, my brain obsesses over anything bad, and something keeps trying to tell me to ruin everything.

I have a loving boyfriend, an easy job, and I'm graduating college in a month. I have everything I need to be happy. Stressed from school, yes, but still happy. But I'm not. I'm miserable. My head keeps telling me to break up with my boyfriend and kill myself. I don't want to, I want to appreciate everything I have so bad yet my brain won't let me. It feels like the only way to shut my brain up is by killing myself.

I've had two therapist. My first one quit with no warning or goodbye, and I dropped my second one because she was making my depression worse. I've been looking for a new therapist for so long, and nothing. I've reached out to so many places and they don't take my insurance. I need help, I'm looking for help, but no one will help me.

I don't want to die. But I hate being inside my head. I was abused growing up, and I would daydream all day long to escape it. I told myself that no matter what my parents did, they could never take away my thoughts. And now I lost them. I lost control of my thoughts. It's hell in here, and I did nothing to deserve this.

661,I wish I was dead,1,128cd00,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/128cd00/i_wish_i_was_dead/,1,"I wish I was dead
Nothing brings me joy anymore. School is a grind I just go through the motions every day, if I don’t exceed expectations I feel sick and anxious. At the same time I feel so numb inside I can’t be bothered to put in any effort. It’s just a constant cycle. No effort = bad grades = stress = no effort. And repeat. Sports are touchy because I do truly enjoy playing hockey,  however I’m not good enough at it to go anywhere with it in life, so when I do succeed my happiness is always short lived, knowing that in the grand scheme of things it’s for nothing. Football is another story I feel no joy in playing it, my dad forces me to. I don’t enjoy standing in the hot sun 2 hours a day after school when I could just go home and do Jack shit and at least be in my own “safe” space. It’s incredibly petty to complain about something about that but I don’t even care anymore. The other people I play with always make me feel like shit, if they’re better than me I feel like trash, if im better than them I feel like im not far enough ahead, always worried they could catch up at any time. Last year i even had an incident where I was bullied by one of the coaches. He saw me screwing around with my friend and on my next rep he sent his biggest corner back to toss me into the dirt (in front of everyone who proceeded to make fun of me and call me a little bitch for the next week). I’ve wanted to quit for 2 years now but I couldn’t live with myself if I quit and disappointed my dad. I go to the gym pretty regularly yet a similar thing to football happens there. If I see someone stronger than me I feel weak, if I’m stronger than someone I feel they’re gonna catch up to me in no time. I have no real reason to feel this depressed. I have a loving family (even if my dad can be sort of a dick sometimes) I’m tall and athletic, I’m certainly not super hot or anything but I’m not ugly, I get good grades for the most part (at least up until this year) I have at least a few good friends in my group. My one friend however has decided to shame me for not having a girlfriend, even though I helped set him up with my cousin. I’m almost cripplingly awkward around girls my age and even up until this year around other guys, I’m always afraid they will make fun of me so I essentially go into a shell when trying to talk to a popular kid in my grade, or any girl. I think about killing myself often yet I can never bring myself to do it, always too afraid to take my own life and end this numb, empty suffering. Almost comically I also belittle myself for not being able to go through with killing myself. If I ever do kill myself I would like at least the people on this site to know who I am.

678,"My long-term plan (reposted, short version)",1,128agjh,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/128agjh/my_longterm_plan_reposted_short_version/,0,"I am a male in my late 20s and have been suffering from mental health issues for roughly the past decade (increasingly so within the last couple years or so), which detrimentally affects my ability to function in my daily life (i.e. how I fit in socially, how I interact, or avoid doing so, with other people, how I see the world, etc.) and makes me feel ever so hopeless about the future, because it feels like getting even older for many more decades will likely aggravate some of those issues. Some of my coping mechanisms aren’t exactly healthy or constructive (quite the opposite), and often aren’t potent enough to help me cope, which often leaves me in a dark headspace. And at times it feels like my mental health is also starting to affect my physical health, as I often started noticing random body aches, headaches, etc. recurring from time to time, often at inconvenient times, more than before. Before I go any further, I want to preface that I’m not looking for suicide helplines (I’ve received counseling several times during the past few years and continue to seek ongoing support where I can find it), being told to appreciate/cherish life or just “suck it up and deal with it”, or anything like that.

I am NOT acutely suicidal (at least not right now), but I do have a long term desire to opt out of life, ideally sometime within the next 10–15 years or so. Assuming that I will have that opportunity, my plan is to live out those remaining years doing things I enjoy, including hobbies, traveling, (trying to) build a career, etc. For anyone curious, the reason for the 10–15 year timeframe is because some of the things on my bucket list that I want to do or be around to see happen aren’t expected to happen for at least that long. However, if they get deferred by several more years (or what feels like indefinitely) for reasons out of my control, and/or if my need to opt out becomes more pressing for any reason, I might have to give up on those things and pursue my ultimate goal sooner rather than later; ideally I wouldn’t want to go any further past 30, because even the 20s have always seemed so extra and unnecessary (although in hindsight, the early 20s don’t seem so bad now compared to the late 20s, which incidentally coincides with pre-pandemic vs. post-pandemic), but my bucket list might be worth sticking around just a few years longer than that. I have been closely following the latest updates on certain organizations that would be very useful to me in the future.

At this point I can only hope that I will be successful in achieving my final goal, I would be absolutely devastated and overcome with existential dread if every single organization I approach a decade from now turns me away. And now I’m also worried about blowing my chances in case someone who actually works at any of those organizations ends up reading this and jumps to the wrong conclusions. I already have a dreadful feeling as I type this that my chances are slim to none, that all those organizations would have already made up their mind about me, or just outright don’t want to deal with people like me whatsoever (because, you know, I’m not a celebrity or anything, just some loser who still lives with his parents and has very limited life experience for his age, so what do I know), long, long before I’d even try to reach out to any of them.",1680321559.0

I've wanted to die since middle school at least, and it's been a bit off and on. Don't have too much of a reason for it, just always had a deep underlying hatred for everything I am. My response to doing anything wrong in elementary school was to punch myself in the head until I couldn't anymore, so what can I expect I guess. 

Never was abused or bullied, have minimal trauma that to even consider it so is disrespectful to the word. I'm a recent college grad with a great job, my educational and career goals are proceeding exceedingly well, lots of great and supportive friends, family that while sucky sometimes, is still around and is always there for me. 

But, I just don't want to be here anymore. I hate my existence. 

Every time I do something I dislike about myself it gets stronger and stronger, and usually I just push it off by thinking I deserve a more painful and suffering death than I'm capable of doing, but honestly I've always just been too much of a coward to do it. Hell I still am, resorting to something so low effort as a gun. 

What's had me made up my mind is the words someone I really value said the other day. We went in a group to an island to camp, drink, and have a good time partying. Earlier on in the night, she made a statement that really resonated for me. 

If someone's suicidal, they should just do it and get it over with.

She's gone through a lot, and has had her owns struggles with suicide. Her's actually well deserved, she's had a ton of trauma in her life, so much that her therapist has been like ""Damn that's a lot of trauma. I'm surprised you're not dead yet."" 

Ofc she did make the quip ""Or lose yourself in drugs and alcohol, like me!"", right after. Everyone laughs. 

Her words really felt right though. I've put myself through so much bullshit, and what's the point. I'm eventually just going to do it anyways. Might as well get it over with before I hurt even more people with it. 

So a little while later, after thinking about things a bit, I just leave the group that was by the fire on the beach and go back to my hammock on the other side of the island. I order the gun that I've been meaning to get just to plink around with friends at the range so I don't have to keep borrowing, but have been putting off cause I have other purchasing priorities. Though, when I order it now it's entirely for the purpose of shooting myself. 

I was thinking I was just going to head back to the group and enjoy the rest of the night after, but I just stare aimlessly for the rest of the night and into the next day in my hammock. Get up in the morning, eat something and hang for a little, then go back to the hammock and just do nothing until it's time to pack up and leave. 

Kinda just been existing, waiting since then. Ignored some friends who wanted to hang out earlier in the week, started to feel like getting out today with a friend, but that fell through. I doubt I would have been a very fun person to be around tho, so probably for the best. 

I'm putting off writing my personal statement for my grad school application by doing this rn too, should probably get back to it soon since it's due in a couple hours. 

The gun should be getting to my LGS Monday. I'll have to drop in and pay the FFL + background check fee, and wait 3 days to pick it up since I never got around to snagging a cwp. Should have it by Friday. 

I have an eye exam Friday too, think I'll still go. Would be rude to bail on an appointment, even if it's not going to make a difference for me anyways.

I’ve had a brain injury and fibromyalgia. I’ve had neck and back pain I’d been seeing a chiropractor for for six months, and at the end of it he fucked up my back on purpose because of how much of an asshole I’ve been. I can’t move my neck without pain and it’s so stiff that my head snaps in movement at times and it gives me another concussion. The only income I had was delivery driving and now I can’t do that anymore after the new concussions have started. I tried tonight after a week long break and got dizzy and lightheaded after 30 minutes and almost got in an accident. 

The thing is is that I’ve tried fighting this. I spent hours writing and fine tuning three notes to loved ones. But then I reached out to a friend and he saved my life with a phone call. Told me he’d always be there for me whenever I need it. He was so supportive and kind. I even made a few daily to do lists and cooked dinner one night.

All of my pain makes me such an asshole, and when I’m triggered into that pain I can’t control how I act and speak. How I process information is so slow and fucked up that it turns up all of my flaws and shitty habits up to such a high intensity. 

I’ve been an asshole to that supportive friend over texts today even after all he’s done for me. That’s been the last few years I’ve been dealing with all of this pain: I’m burning bridges and hurting everyone that’s cared about me. And then I feel so guilty and ashamed and still have to deal with all of my physical pain and disassociation on top of all of those burned bridges. 

I look crazy when I’m out in the world. My eyes twitch and flare up from my eye strain and stress I switch back and forth from either looking despondent or angry all of the time when I’m really just in pain and trying to survive, barely hanging on and fully aware of not just how I present myself to others but how there’s nothing I can do about it. And that I never will be able to. Not only do I not trust doctors after what happened with my chiropractor, but I don’t trust myself around them. 

I’ve had three options: say shitty things to others, pull back so that I don’t hurt anyone else and ghost people without being able to explain and apologize, or end my life. 

Now I just need to make amends and try to give some peace and closure for all of the people that have cared about and have been good to me. There’s so many others that I’ve cared about and wish I could reach out to, but know that they never want to hear from me again because of the damage I’ve caused. 

I don’t want to sound like an asshole and have my last message to people make things even worse. I want to make things right but there’s no other way to if I can’t pull off writing these. I can explain everything. All that happens with my apologies in my current misery is that I can’t make any changes to back them up, and my awareness of my problematic behavior and crazy expression isn’t followed by any change. I’ve tried, I really have. But it’s not possible. 

I’m so miserable and am in so much pain and I can’t take this anymore. Any time my pain kicks in, (even from eating or drinking just about anything because of how poorly I’ve taken care of my teeth, and a cross bite that flares up my teeth and jaw that needs jaw surgery that I can’t afford), I disassociate, and my engagement and mood and personality switches. This fucks with my memory. Another reason I can’t hold down a job to get out of this hole.

There’s a bridge I have picked out to jump off of. A 135 foot drop, and it’d only take a second and a half to hit the water. I’m gonna text or email everyone their notes if I can finish them. 11 more to go. 

There’s no other way for my pain to end.",1680313273.0

I’m posting this here because I’m not sure what else to do.

Every single day I’m fighting an overwhelming urge to want to end my life. My entire family sees that I’m struggling and I’m given absolutely zero help.

I feel so angry and defeated by my circumstances.

For the days I find hardest, I drink and use recreational drugs.

Earlier today, I found about 15 empty hard-liquor bottles that I’ve been hiding. 

Every time I see myself in a mirror, I get a flash of adrenaline and anger. I can’t stand myself. For the past couple of years, my hair has been falling out in clumps and it’s like watching myself deteriorate every time I look in the mirror. My family think it’s a joke.

The only things I have to deter me are:

1) The effect that it would have on my mother who recently experienced a near-fatal stroke.

2) Being unsuccessful in my attempt. 

The thought of waking up tomorrow and repeating this process is unbearable. All I can think of is heading to the liquor store to find the strongest thing possible.

I’ve been on anti-depressants for over a year and feel nothing from them.

Like most ppl, initially the thought of suicide was appalling to me and I never understood how someone could just kill themselves. But as I got older I realized that there are many fates much much worse than (even a painful but quick) death.

As you can probably deduct from this stupid post, I am rather „different“. I don’t fit in, like at all.

So yeah, one thing led to another and I started asking myself why I always keep trying so hard with everything. Additionally I experienced several failures in life and an injury, further undermining my previous drive to move on no matter what. 

Well for a year now I’ve been researching suicide methods, just to know what my options are, but I certainly don’t have what it takes to kill myself for now. Still, I’m fairly certain that eventually I might kill myself. 

Im 22, doing great in university, and don’t have financial issues. I know, however, where all of this is going. A life of solitude, the highlight of my week being a quick wank and the next bout of sciatica. I always used to have a plan to look forward to, but these days I’ve realized that while this plan will certainly be achievable, it won’t bring any happiness. What I truly want in life is completely out of reach for me, and I can only try to ever approximate my desires.

This might be controversial, but I am annoyed that I’d have to resort to something like this. It would be so much easier if there was just a lever to switch and make your life stop. A safe and supervised method of suicide would make the whole thing much less traumatic for everyone involved. For the life to end when there’s nothing to achieve just seems to be rational.

So what exactly is the sense of all this? What keeps you going? Why should I even bother to get up in the morning?

It’s the first and hopefully last time I’m telling anyone about these thoughts. For now I probably just want some attention.",1680296064.0

And now everything is turning for the worse, i just don't have any gas left. 
Didn't take a vacation or a day off in many years, i just had sick days.

Spent 43 days this year in the bus. 
Spent 42 sleeping.
Played with the kids for 20.
Spent 10 with the love of my life in the evenings.
The rest i worked. And yet i can't get a foothold because i don't fit into the society my parents decided to throw me into at 15. 
I'm loosing my mind.

I read a lot, know or knew, heh, a lot. 
Always wanted to understand the world, maybe it wouldn't be as scary then. Turned out it's much worse out there then expected. 

There's pain, hurt and desperation out there,
The normies are only winning because they're fine with manipulation and abusing others. They're fine with sitting on someone's back and riding the wave. Fake fucks.

Afterwards, I haven't been able to get rid of them. Currently fantasizing about killing myself whenever I feel down. Sometimes, even a little inconvenience is enough to drive me to that point. Hatred I have towards my self seems immeasurable.

Worst thing is, I am too aftraid to open up to my friends about it. The last time I tried it, some other friends interpreted it as ""attention seeking"", or being a ""drama queen"". I have a new cycle of friends, but I am afraid smt similar will happen. Or my family, who already thinks I am crazy, because I am on medication.

I grew up with a sentiment of dread towards the many challenges that people told me I was going to face in life. To this day i still feel numb and empty when  thinking about certain things in life, like how having a job is exhausting and leaves no time for other stuff, and so on. 

But the one thing that kept me going was the possibility of finding love and friendship, I thought everything woukld be worth it if I was able to have good people surrounding me and find true love. But when I grew up, I realised I was ugly and most girls didn't want to be near me because of that. First I thought like I was a bit weird but still looked normal, but it's not that. I truly am ugly, I have terrible face symmetry, i'm balding since 16 and I have patchy/lacking facial hair. I also have scoliosis and my body isn't in a good shape either. 

If you can imagine a good looking person even with that stuff I said, know that I truly am ugly. The undeniable proof to me is the way girls started treating me after I started shaving my head: i get ignored often and the ones that do respond treat me like a comfort guy who they just go to after a bad day and then don't talk to again for weeks. I also have been called ugly by girls in more than one ocasion, and that hurt me a lot.

People generally don't believe me and say that ""i'm probably not that ugly"" or ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" which is total bs. There are beauty standards and I feel like i'm not in the good-looking group. Want more proof? my Tinder experience. When  I was younger I tried Tinder and got a ton of matches, before the balding got super bad. Now i rarely get any matches at all, and most girls don 't even respond. I tried switching things up, tried being less funny and stuff, tried just saying ""Hi"" but it really didn't work. Just get dead silence. I tried creating new accounts, reseting Tinder elo, changing pics, changing my bio and approach, but it seems to me that this Tinder place is only for the good looking people. It really makes me sad and suicidal everytime i log in and see all the ignored messages.

Want even more proof? Ok. I posted my pics on the AmIUgly subreddit and most people there found an issue with my photos and my looks. Got some people being really mean in those comments and that made me feel kinda bad. Most people were just plain and direct tho, they just said ""yes"". They gave me some solutions to my looks, like hitting the gym (I'm trying really hard to not quit the gym) or buying new clothes and new glasses and stuff, but I don't think that will fix my ugly face structure and bald head. It just hurts so much to know it wasn't me making up stuff: people do perceive me as ugly.

I really am in a very bad place rn because all of that, I had an suicide attempt last year and i'm afraid i'll go back to this behaviour soon. My therapist is trying so hard to get me out of the house and doing sutff, but I feel like shit. If I go to a party and get rejected, I'll probably try suicide again, and that kind of scares me. I know it all sound pathetic, an ugly dude wanting to kill himself because no one wants to fuck him, but that's my life right now. 

If I could just accept that i'm ugly, give up on trying to talk to girls and move on, I think it would make me happier. But I always go back to Tinder and girls DMs, trying desperately to get their attention. I really feel like I'm beyond salvation at this point.

Until one day everything fell apart because my past mistakes caught up to me. Since then, I've lost everything. I have forced myself to continiue to love until now in hopes that it will get better. It didn't, everything only got worse. I'm completely alone now, I've lost all of my friends and the person that I love hates me. I'm getting kicked out of my university and my apartment next month, I have no job and no money. 

The only thing left for me is to die. I want to apologize to everyone in this subreddit who's suffering. I was extremely fortunate in my life (except for being beaten and mentally abused my parents for 18 years), and I threw it all away by being a horrible human being.

I was an atheist my whole life but I hope there is an afterlife or atleast parallel universes so I can die in peace knowing that atleast another version of me exists that is happy. 

I'm gonna spend the next weeks doing what I love before I'm forced out of my apartment and then I will end it all. I love life, but I can't live with my mistakes anymore. I hope I will get the chance to pet a cat once more before I die.

It takes a lot for me to have these thoughts. I don’t normally feel bad about myself, but these last few years and today especially was just too much.

I‘m a 23 yo in a conservative Muslim country. I got into an arranged marriage when I was 19 to a man who is 20 years older than me. After so much physical abuse I finally decided to separate from him, but then he flipped things around to make it look like he wants to separate so he can avoid paying the alimony legally in my country.

We recently divorced without alimony because he succeeded in staining my reputation. He spread around rumors about me being unfaithful. Those still haunt my every waking moment and I constantly run into threats of honor killing and the like.

He told my family I cheated to avoid paying the alimony. Alimony is a legal right of every divorced wife (unless she was unfaithful).

It’s been a year since we’ve been divorced, but this subject is just never going away. My family keeps bringing it up and it would get so intense that I would get some threats.

I feel very helpless. Part of me refuses to give up, and another part of me is too afraid to stick around to witness what could happen to me.

I’m too mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausted to put up any fight. This has been going on for over a year now.

There is a chance that the situation can calm down, and I can have better days than today, but that chance is just not likely enough for me to continue. I need to hear from someone who could share a different perspective.

Dealing with health issues has made me think about my quality of life in the future and what will most likely happen. Didn't like the conclusion I came to, so here I sit. I'm keeping the mask on around my friends/coworkers/loved ones so they won't suspect a thing. So that no one will try to stop me.

Writing and editing letters to people I've known over the years to say I'm sorry and to let them know there was nothing they could do to save me at this point. I wish i could send the letters to friends who could write them better than I  could, but that would defeat the purpose if my plan was found out before i was ready.

Then it was also my younger brother, although I know he’d be okay without me unlike the others, I don’t want to add any more trauma to his life.

Well now my dad has started taking advantage of me, and I’ve begun to hate him. I’m starting to regret taking over this dog…I love him to death, but two things bother me. The first being that he should have been rehomed to a wealthier, more active and happy family. He deserves more than I can give, and his normal dog behavior once were tiny annoyances, drive me so insane I want to rip my hair out or start crying.  And for my brother, well. I’ve gotten so low I’ve become selfish in that area. I know if I went through with it, I’d do everything I can to make it less painful for him.

We are the product of trillions of cells that evolved in such a way that we became complex creatures and gained consciousness and when we die the same cells decompose and we won’t know anything, it’s gonna be like we were never even born. When i’m dead I won’t care that i lived my dream life and it’s all gonna be for nothing. If someone  dies at 70, old and happy, or at 6, it is exactly the same, since no one will be there anymore to suffer the consequences of death when your consciousness slips away and the universe moves on. 

The chance that i am living right now, in the time period of the universe when i have consciousness, is very small. The universe has been around for billions of years and will be around for more billions. I am living in the short period of my potential life, which is around 70 years from those billions. The universe has and will exist without me until it ends, except those 70 years which i am living right now.

769,I've given up,2,127rawc,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/127rawc/ive_given_up/,0,"I feel like I'm not allowed to have anything good in my life. 

I've experienced passive suicidal thoughts for almost half of my shitty existence on this planet, starting when my terminally ill father died of cancer. The other half was spent watching it eat him alive, I barely have any good childhood memories because in the back of my mind I'm aware of the fact that I spent twelve years watching the only positive male figure I ever had waste away until he was just a sack of skin and bones. This trauma has just left me with a deep rooted depression that I've never truly been able escape.

My mother was never the same after he passed. She's been cold and distant. She's never opened up, or maybe I never opened up to her when it mattered. She became goal oriented and completely ignores anything related to emotions. This just created an insurmountable pressure that makes me feel like my existence isn't good enough, I used to try really hard to meet her expectations, mostly academically. I was a ""gifted child"" getting A's for almost everything that mattered, but it didn't matter. Nothing was good enough if it wasn't 100% or if I didn't make a plan to get 100% the next time. So I gave up on her, and I gave up on trying.

Life just progressively got worse and the thoughts of ending my pain became more frequent until around 3 and a half years ago, when I met my now ex-girlfriend. She was the only person who has ever made an actual attempt to make me feel validated, and like it was okay for me to be myself for me. And I did everything I could for her, it was perfect, really. We had ups and downs like all couples do, but never about anything serious. She's a good person, her whole family are good people, overwhelmingly so, and in many ways were more like a family to me than my actual blood relatives. But I've lost that too now, completely out of the blue, with no other reason than she needs to ""find out who she is without me ""

The past 6 days have been hell 

It started with the death of my only grandfather, the very next day my girlfriend breaks up with me for a reason that she understands but I can't even begin to fathom, and on Wednesday I got into a car accident, losing my only mode of transport. 

I've been thrown into the deep end, and I don't know what else to do. 

Balancing my full time job with university was already hard enough. Now I'm expected to do that while grieving and these severe feelings of insignificance related to losing the only person who would actually tell me they loved me. All without a fucking affordable way to move around. 

I don't hate my job, but the pay is dogshit, like most jobs in my country. It now costs half of my daily pay just to get to and from work, and the other half to get to university and back. Alot of that money was supposed to be going to university fees that my single mother can barely afford. It's not that I feel like I've become a burden, I actually have become one 

And still the only things I can think about are my ex and killing myself. 

I can't imagine any positives to continuing this existence. I've been planning to end it all since the day of the funeral. My thoughts have shifted from thinking I'd be better of dead to actually planning what I'm going to do. I just want it to be painless, I've had enough pain. Sometimes i just wish I had the courage or motivation to actually fucking do it. I feel like a coward.

I don't want to live a life filled with anxiety and depression that I know I just can't escape from. I've given up. Entirely.",1680281010.0

1)My mom's family is abusive, they constantly judge me even back when I was religious. When I stopped being religious due to them constantly adding pressure (why didn't you pray at the mosque, why didn't you go for friday prayers, I want you to read the fuckin' quran every single day) and my mom sticking religious posters all over my room without my consent.

2)My mom holds my money and won't let me hold a single cent now, she won't let me go out without interrogating me. everytime i bring a friend over, she would say bad stuff and convince me to break ties with them.

3)my aunt would let her baby's cry echo throughout the whole house, which reminded me of my nightmarish past even when I try to avert my thoughts my body would tremble

&#x200B;

4)My uncle threatened to kill me, as I closed the dining room door just to reduce the noise of his baby crying. He slammed it closed

&#x200B;

5)My biological dad no longer wants to see me 

&#x200B;

6)When I was 17, my 3 uncles beat me till I was bloody because one of their kids accused me of beating him up even though all I did was push them away as they were hitting me. My mom's family begged me to not call the cops, but when I had a breakdown they called the cops on me and threatened to lock me up

Extremely unhealthy obsession with someone- I am going to try to be as honest as possible for my sake this time. 
I would like to start off saying I have many mental illnesses making me struggle daily and I know this is not a normal thing for the average person, this is why I’m telling my story.

I’ve always looked up to this man, I’ve always been attracted to him and kind of liked the way he was so mean to me which made it more special when he wanted to speak to me. Sometimes he’d want nothing to do with me and I was okay with that, then sometimes he’d want to speak with me which felt like a big rush, like when you find out super super exciting news. We were never close and I was never super obsessed with him because I knew I could never get to the point of having him

Let’s go back to a year ago from now. Finally he shows actual interest in me, we start rambling about so many things that both him and I are very passionate about, he doesn’t want me to stop talking to him, we spoke for hours and hours giving me an insane rush. 3 days staying up all night talking to eachother.  Him and I were both in a terrible mental state at that time and what was said and done shouldn’t have been. He tells me he thinks he likes me… or maybe loves, which was really confusing to him as he’s never felt this way for me. I spilled everything and told him I’ve always been attracted to him and that I really like him too. 

I’m going to leave out some parts here so this isn’t easily identified as me.. sorry  

Things happened and him and I weren’t able to talk for a bit, I obsessed over him. I would cry and throw up about how much I missed him- note that we didn’t even talk much before the whole “I like you” situation happened, I couldn’t sleep, I would drink every day, I was so sick and miserable in my life. I would write messages to him every single day or throughout the day and create notes as if I was speaking with him. I was disgustingly obsessed

I eventually convinced myself I’d never speak to him again and created a chat alone with his name and spoke to that as if he was dead. I would say how much I miss him and beg for him to come back, I would scream and cry begging for him to come back. It was horrible and disgusting 

He comes back a couple months later and we try to catch up, I am still extremely obsessed with this man and sick to my stomach. I would stare at my phone waiting for a reply from him, I would set alarms for his schedule so I could speak to him, I tried my best not to show how strung up I was though. If he didn’t reply accordingly I would have panic attacks and feel like he hates me. Eventually It all built up and I was frustrated in the moment and I ended up blocking him on everything so I’d stop speaking to him, it hurt for a very long time afterwards but I eventually started thinking about him less and less. I recovered from this addiction.

3 days ago I had a dream about this man and he will not stop running through my head. I am so tired of this and I need help but the help isn’t helping. Please don’t comment if you’re going to call me crazy, I know. I’m diagnosed with many mental illnesses.",1680246989.0

799,"I'm really scared for my own life because I have 2 weeks home alone, I don't know what to do to save myself. I have no excuses though, if I want to die, I can now finally die (17M).",2,127kppe,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/127kppe/im_really_scared_for_my_own_life_because_i_have_2/,0,"I have a 2 week holiday from uni, but an exam the day we come back. My family had to leave me behind at home by myself while they went on a 2 week holiday since I couldn't defer it and I need to get a good grade on this exam. They have provided me with the essentials to stay safe and alive, but they don't know I'm actively suicidal. They just know that I had one episode a while back, and that's it. I've been in therapy and they think everything is fine. It is not fine and no matter how hard I try, therapy is not helping me. 

I don't have any friends and have struggled making new friends at uni due to my personality and lack of social skills. I had the same issue in high school and only made like 3 friends, but I never cared then since my end goal was to graduate with a good final mark. Well, getting into uni was like getting blasted into the real world, and now I'm slowly realising how lonely I really am and now it's really effecting me that I may never have any real friends. I want to make friends, but I never seem to connect with anyone. I don't have any hobbies because I'm too depressed to do anything other than the studying to survive my uni classes, and I take rejection way too seriously. 

On top of the depression due to my studying issues in high school, I know have depression relating to feeling lonely and anxious, and also from the stress caused by the workload at uni. The depression has gotten worse. On top of that I am hyper sexual and I can't control my masturbation tendencies. This makes me feel really gross and I never have time to study because of it. This has also caused a porn addiction, and I've constantly tried and failed to get rid of it. This too makes me even more depressed. I can't even bring it up in therapy since I'm still a minor and my parents might get involved (which would be even worse). 

I have also had many more insecurities prop up that I never used to have in high school, like things about my height, weight and just over all looks in general. It doesn't help that my brother is now like 6 inches taller than me and calls me short. I'm just below average height, but I've noticed overall how unattractive I am. 

I also avoided learning how to drive because I thought I didn't need it, and I never got a job. I never realised how I'm so different to the average teenager, but I guess the reality has now sunken in. Before the suicidal thoughts were always related to my grades, but now they feel more personal, like their attacking me as a person. 

I have 2 weeks to catch up on my workload, and this is day 0 of that. I've already procrastinated and masturbated for the last 5 hours, and have gotten nothing done. My motivation to do anything is at an all time low, and I've been eating all the junk food my parents brought for me to survive the 2 weeks alone. I'm basically feeling really miserable right now and my mood is at an all time low. 

I have 2 weeks in this home all alone to decide if I want to kill myself and how I want to do it. I can go anywhere I want in the city and my parents wouldn't know about it as long as I don't take public transport. I can literally kill myself in so many possible ways it's kind of overwhelming. I've never had this freedom before, and I always felt limited by my parent's supervision to do anything about suicide. 

But at the same time I promised my parents I would take care of myself, and I don't want them coming home to a dead son. But I want to die so badly too. I'm in a really difficult position and the thoughts to kill myself have kind of taken over everything I now do (studying and procrastinating basically). I feel like an outcast at uni, and it hurts to go there and see everyone having a good time learning while I'm trying to keep up with the workload learning all by myself. I'm so scared and I have literally no one to talk to about it. 

I just want to wake up tomorrow and have a group of friends, not have hyper sexual behaviour, be confident with myself, grow taller, look more handsome, be in control of my studying, not have brain for all the time, be fit and maybe even have a girlfriend. 

Basically the complete opposite of what I am today. But that will never happen, not in a day. The only way that will happen is if I'm in control of my self perception and my will to get better, if I put in the effort to try everyday to be a better man. See the issue here? I've tried and failed at doing that. I tried making friends and got rejected. I tried quitting porn and failed attempt after attempt. I tried being comfortable with my looks but always realise how unattractive I am. I tried so fucking hard to study every day, but my masturbation addiction and brain fog make it impossible. I tried eating less and losing weight, but all that it's led to is starving myself due to my loss in appetite and then just eating junk food to make myself feel better. I tried exercise and my legs hurt for 4 days straight. I've tried everything to change, and nothing has changed in my life. 

This leads me to my conclusion. There's only one thing left to do and that's to kill myself. I will never be who I want to be, and it would be better to end the fruitless efforts than to live regretting my decisions. I have 2 weeks to do it. I have 2 weeks to change my mind. I won't cower though, not this time. There's no one in my life that can stop me now. No friends, and now finally no family. My therapists are on break and now I'm the most alone I've ever been. 

I see an alternative time line where maybe I grew up as a normal teenager and had friends, learnt how to drive, messed around, maybe even had my first kiss. Perhaps maybe this was all just a bad dream and I'll wake up in that life. Hopefully fingers crossed. It's not that I actually want to die and never live life you know? I just want to live a different version of my life, so I guess I'm not completely suicidal?

I mean I've contemplated suicide before you know, and now what's stopping me? I have literally no excuses this time like family stopping me, so if I really want to die, I should die. Sometime in the next two weeks I should end it. 

I wish I could say I loved the time I spent on Earth, but I really can't. Goodbye fellow redditors. To those that read up to this, you may have just read the suicide note of a 17 year old that's about to kill himself. 

Thanks for reading this. Even if a couple of people read up to here it's more than enough to be honest, since literally 0 people have ever been told about these thoughts. Uh so yeah, have fun with your lives and I hope they become better. I'm heading to sleep now.",1680267562.0

momma, you kept me here for as long as possible. thank you for bending over backwards for me no matter the time. you took me in during my lowest and even after witnessing my atrocities you always just wanted me to strive and be happy. i forgive you for the strife caused in every sense of the world and have always used you as an example of how to be as a young human. you are my rock, my salvation and my happiness. thank you for every single smile you’ve sent my way. 

to my friends, i love you all so fucking much. nobody in the world has been blessed like i have with you guys. not a single, single soul. you all kept me so, so alive while i could be. even if given the offer to have sleepovers and cause mischief with any other people. nbc on top for ever. <3

you’re not only my “goddess”, but my god.

i’m so sorry and as i write this in my bed in and out of consciousness i feel guilt i never thought was possible. i just want to be at the peace that a normal person can feel. you all provide this for me, and that is what makes you all special. but now, i know i must find it within my own soul. 

i am at peace now, hopefully.

I sleep on a couch in the living room that I share with two of my brothers and they don't care when I'm trying to sleep. I don't get enough sleep because I live with 7 other people and 4 dogs and they don't care.

I never learned to drive because I dropped out of high school and my mother can't teach anything without screaming. I have a job but it doesn't pay enough for me to ever get my own place.

My mom keeps telling me I need to go to school while I'm living with her, but it's not like I can afford school either. I don't know what I would want to do, and I can't drive anyway. No job will make me happy.

I know he is right, i'm an ungrateful shit, so i'm planning to save money in whatever way i can. While it's impossible to give them back their time, i can at least try to give them back their money.

I'm sitting in the floor of my bathroom while I'm writing this. In this tiny room I have everything I need to make me leave, but I'm missing something and is the courage to do it. I don't want to fail while doing it, and I dont want my mom to see me like that, even if we do not have the best relationship I would never do that to my family. 

I'm twenty years old and I'm afraid as fuck of life. I'm mentally exhausted. I've been thinking about doing this for about a while now, lately it has been worse and worse: the thoughts are present almost every day. Nobody likes to feel like this, and I've been trying to get better but it's not working and I don't know what to do but feel overwhelmed and scared of myself. 

I don't really have a bad life, that's the worst part of all, that I dont have a bad life at all but I don't know why I feel so empty, depressed and angry all the time. It's ruining everything, I am not capable of controlling the emotions and thoughts.

I know that today won't happen, I might just get up and take a warm shower and then I will go to sleep. But tomorrow is another day that I have to face, I am really tired to keep going - still too scared to leave. I dont want to be selfish with myself, but I'm drowning in the things I will never say because I'm too scared.

My whole life I’ve been depressed. I come from a divorced, abusive, toxic family in both sides and have always been in some degree or another of poverty. I had three parents that I chose, each was my biological grandparent, and who chose to try to help raise me despite their abusive and often absentee children being horrific parents without anything nurturing in their nature. Both of them are narcissistic. I have been victimized sexually, emotionally, and physically since I can remember. Luckily for me the sexual stuff was sporadic. Unluckily for me, it happened at home and elsewhere. 


I have multiple disabilities that affect me daily, including physical and mental health issues. I struggle with chronic pain that’s so bad I can’t even have the back of my head on a pillow without an ice pack or heating pad under it. My memory issues get worse and worse all the time. I’m nearing 27 years old and I feel like I’m 90. 

My whole life I’ve been bullied. At school. At home. At churches. And I too have been a bully, I’m sure, mostly as a teenager. I have been neglected, starved, and force fed until I puked. I have acted heinously. I have made the same mistakes over and over again. 

1 of my 2 chosen mothers died of lung cancer the first day of middle school for me. My other chosen mother died a few years ago after a long and painful battle with dementia, Alzheimer’s, and then bone cancer. By the end there was nothing left of her but skin and bone. She didn’t know who I was for years, and didn’t even know who she was. She went from a strong woman to withering away into an abyss she was trapped in for years. I watched my dad(grandpa) watch his wife fade away for years. 

My grandpa is my best friend. He was a mom and a dad and a grandparent and a mentor and a friend all in one. He was the closest thing to unconditional love I’ve ever known. And he died suddenly a few years ago. And I had no warning. I’ve lost other people this way too, but they were never this integral to my being. 

Ever since he died, I feel like I died too. I’ve struggled with thoughts of ending my life since I was little, and have self harmed or attempted suicide in the past. For years now, I’ve been doing seemingly better, and haven’t attempted suicide in a very long time. But sometimes it just crashes down on me, since my dad died. It all comes at once. He was the last life raft of stability and normalcy I had in my biological family. Everyone else I’m either estranged from for my own safety, or have to deal with despite their toxicity but do so sparingly. 

I used to feel a drive to succeed one day. I dreamt of college and careers and being independent as a young girl. But my bad choices and bad health have messed up my education so many times that I still haven’t even finished my BAs. I only got my AAs last spring. I feel like a massive failure. 

I started getting better grades after my dad died, oddly. Everything else went downhill, but somehow that went up. But now I’m missing work and school constantly once again and I keep self sabotaging. I don’t feel a desire to do better anymore because I’ve failed to improve so many times that I’m burnt out. 

It simply feels like the time has been up for me for a while now. I never thought I’d be alive this long, to be honest. I thought I’d be killed or commit suicide or something else sudden and tragic would happen to me. I feel that I’ve outlived my life expectancy in the worst way. I feel like a carton of spoiled milk way past it expiration date. My body and face disgust me, and my personality and choices make me nauseas, and yet I feel numb. 

I had a therapist for years who was sliding scale. She quit last summer, retired. But even when I had her, and even with medications, I still end up here, wondering if I should just end it already and stop suffering for good. Stop hurting others and myself. Stop failing. 

I feel unsafe and unwelcome in the world. I feel lost. I can’t see past poverty and pain and ugliness being my lot in life. The future looks black to me now. My path is gone. I feel totally lost and like nothing matters anymore. 

I don’t know what to do.  I do the suicide hotline thing. I tried therapy until I could no longer access it and even when I had it it didn’t cure me. I have a loving partner and even that didn’t cure me. I feel that I only burden him with my pain and complexity and mistakes. He constantly has to fix things for me. He deserves better. I just don’t know what to do. I can’t even get out of bed or eat or shower. Sometimes for a day, sometimes for days or weeks. I’m just in so much pain that I’m numb. I don’t know what to do. I thought moving to a dorm would help me but I feel lonelier than ever and the string of on campus sexual assaults just makes everything worse. 

Usually it’s just a thought but today I have the impulse to hurt myself or worse.

I’m so lonely it crushes me. I’m scared to leave my room. Everything is numb and/or scary and I feel like I’m to f*cked up to ever be worthy of love or good enough. I have no drive or motivation left. I’m just here. People have always told me I’m an “old soul”, tough, and strong, resilient. But I’m not. I’m hurting all the time. When is it enough? How much pain is too much to live with? How many mistakes and bad choices can you continually make before it’s enough? How many times can you be a bad partner or friend or student or worker before it’s too much?",1680236496.0

852,I give up.,1,127gf24,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/127gf24/i_give_up/,0,"I think I'm going to kill myself. There's a lot of background so I'll try to cut it down as much as I can. The tl;dr is that for the past few years I've received blow after blow from life culminating in me losing everything I care about and losing my care about everything else...

In 2020, I became closer friends with someone who I'd known for a while but hadn't ever really spoken to before. We had similar interests, hobbies, and we got along pretty well. We became FwB, and as I got to know them over the next 6 or so months, I realised I actually wanted to spend a lot more time with them, maybe even the rest of my life. But not long after I realised that, they shut down on me, and broke things off without giving a reason. I fought for us to stay friends, but there was only so much I could do.

Just before they broke it off, in 2021, I got a job as a secondary school teacher (I would've preferred a college lecturer, but had to start somewhere). However, I was suspended after only a few months due to false allegations made against me. After 6 months of fighting the case over the new year, with the school providing no evidence outside of the students backing each other up, 10 of the 12 allegations were dropped due to fabrications by the deputy headteacher and contradictions in the allegations, with the remaining 2 being held onto because the CCTV at the school didn't work so they chose to believe the students over me. Neither the deputy headteacher nor the students were reprimanded as a result of this and I was basically told that although there wasn't enough evidence to suggest the allegations were true, the trust I work for still thinks I might have done what was alleged, effectively saying that the truth doesn't matter if they believe otherwise, regardless of what I know did and didn't happen.

I managed to transfer within the same trust in 2022 and worked for 6 months, during which time the person I love came back into my life, seemingly confused about what they want and suggesting I should wait for them, which of course I was anyway because I'm an idiot who can't even stop loving someone who hurt me and told me they never wanted to see me again. Then I lost all my friends from outside of work because I refused to speak to one of them after they'd tried to kick me while I was down after the person that I love leaving me in 2021. Not long after this the person I love stopped talking to me at all, despite me saying we needed to talk things through, with them more seeming to want to keep the connection open without having to face the relationship, after basically sending every signal they could that they still had some kind of feelings for me. I took a colleague's advice and sent a letter about how I feel and left things alone. A few months later come to find out they started a relationship while still leaving us connected (FYI I found this out on Valentine’s day).

While all that was going on, after 6 months at my new school, 5 students who disliked me made false allegations against me, with one very similar to one from before. This time only 3 were made, 2 of which were disproved by CCTV (including the very similar one), but only after I'd been suspended for over a month and the school still claims they weren't disproved, just that they don't have enough evidence to prove it. Then my boss tried to give me an 18-month final written warning for the third even though there was another member of staff in the room who says it never happened and I've never done anything to cause concern. 

In 2023, I appealed the decision, it got overturned immediately and there was nothing against me. I spoke to my union about it and they said they felt there was a case, and after speaking with the director of HR he said to write a list of things I feel I need to be able to return to work. I did so, sent him the list asking him to tell me what can and can't be done, and he said I should resign and take a few months’ pay because they won't do anything I asked, when I refused to resign, he threatened to dismiss me, saying I'd caused an “irretrievable breakdown of working relations” and wouldn't be able to claim unfair dismissal because I'm still just over 3 months shy of the 2 years needed to do so. The union suddenly agreed and said they now think there is no case, basically leaving me holding the bag.

So now, I'm all alone, and being told to either choose constructive dismissal or being fired, either way I lose the job I love, can't afford my rent, won't be able to see my colleagues anymore, and the people who did this to me, who failed to show a duty of care to their staff, and who broke the law more than once throughout this whole situation... will never be held accountable for their actions. While I get blamed for what they did because it's cheaper and looks better for the trust.

To top it all off, I haven't slept well in months, with constant insomnia, nightmares, even good dreams that only serve to remind me of how awful life is when I wake up. Not to mention, I've had a phobia of physical contact for years and a worsening hypersensitivity disorder that means the more stressed I am the more painful sound, sight, and touch get. The only person I've been comfortable with touching me for years is the friend I fell in love with, and my parents can't hug me because it makes me extremely uncomfortable and can even cause lasting pain and tics. And, no matter how many times I explain it to them, my parents don't understand how or why I have my phobia, which seems to be because they're part of the cause and don't see hitting and screaming at a child to punish them as wrong as long as it was done with ""good intentions"". 

I've been on mirtazapine for months and now I'm on citalopram, but neither helps, and I've been in therapy for months with not even the smallest signs of improved mental health (if anything it's getting worse). I really wish just one thing would go well for me to give me hope for the future again, but things have never been this bad and I've never felt more alone. I can't live like this anymore, and I can't escape the inevitable loss of everything I hold dear. I'm pretty sure the only reason I didn't succeed in killing myself a year ago is because I still had a miniscule hope that the person I love would come back and we could patch things up, because then even without my job at least I'd have the person I care about most in my life. But it's clear that that's never gonna happen.

So unfortunately, I think I'll just let the world win. No matter how many people say that things will get better, I just don't believe it. My parents are visiting for a week, so I'm going to wait until they've come and gone. I'll probably come back and check on this post once they're gone too, but at this point I really don't care about my life enough to keep on living it.",1680257028.0

I grew up in a brutally abusive household with drug addict parents and grandparents. They said it was all my fault. For a few years in middle school I had friends and helped. 

I couldn't keep in high school. The hope for better being destroyed only made everything worse. My old friends started bully and abuse me. And I was so attached to that hope for love I wouldn't see it and stop talking to them. They started a group chat about me bullying me calling me retard recording me and getting me to say embarrassing things to laugh at me. The teachers joined in. One teacher screamed at me so bad senior year I pissed myself. They all called me piss boy. They wouldn't stop and it was so brutal, I would cry and cry. Again they all said it was my fault and convinced me it was. I am hateable. Everyone hates me and it's because who I am.

 The main bully thought it was funny to act like they dated me after high school. They abused me so bad. Beat me strangled me psychologically played with me mind called me ugly stupid and dumb and retarded. They continued the group chat. Brought my abusive parents in. My mom would come over and have sex with him. They drugged me. Made me lay in the bathtub my mom tried to drown me. They had sex on top of me, squishing me. Made me a little boy. My mom beat me around the room. The bullies dad hit me and knocked me out. The old bullies came over and they did cocaine and took turns beating me. They all told me they hated me and it was my fault. They and my parents had a hate orgy about me they hated me so much. 

I developed amnesia senior year of high school and would forget the intense things until now at 26. They told me one night at 19 they would keep me trapped as their slave for years until they were done with me and then kill me. They would have plants to act like my friend. They did. one who was the best friend part raped me. Bullied me. Again it was all my fault. 

I remembered everything and got them out of my life but they still try to reel me in. They may kill me soon. 

My mom overdosed. As she said, when she dies it will be my fault. I took away her youth. I stole her life. 

I deserve to die. There is no good in the world. No one cares. There is no God. It's all only pain. Only abuse. I am broken and hopeless and no one cares. Everyone has always hated me. My family my friends my teachers. Myself.

I've going through mood cycles since I'm 12. It starts with me doing an exhausting and all-consuming effort to pick me up from the floor. Then I have some good days, weeks, or if I'm lucky, months. But then a depressive episode kicks in. I fall. Crash hard into suicidal ideation and seasons of staying in bed for some 14 hours a day only to feel drowsy and desperate when I'm ""up"", effectively turning myself into a recluse.

&#x200B;

I'm tired of all the lost opportunities, of all apologies and mending talks I have to go through because I let projects and people on hold apparently for no reason other than rudeness or laziness. I'm tired of saving face for myself everytime I ""resurface"" to the living world. I'm tired of all the broken promises I've made to myself, of not being a trusting person to my own eyes. I can't rely on myself to lead me to a good existence.

I've been to therapy, medication and psychiatrics. I've tried getting sun, changing diets, exercise, talking to people and friends, breathing techniques, meditation, helping others, vitamins and nootropics, drugs and partying, counting my blessings... You name it, chances are I've tried it in order to make me feel more stable.

&#x200B;

As a 40 something I know this is not going to get better for me. The crashes are becoming more damaging with time. As a teenager I would raise concern among my classmates and family members. I would miss classes and good grades. Then I started falling behind on my dreams. Then I would lose long-time partners to it. Then I would lose jobs. The stakes are becoming higher.  I'm quite damaged goods. Last partner I had was 5.5 years ago. I don't think I'll ever find another partner since I know very well no-one is going to put up with the challenges of a person that keeps falling time and again. It's draining to the other person and I no longer expect anyone to put up with it - I hardly am because I have no choice. Knowing I will remain single for the rest of my days is maddening sad.

&#x200B;

Also I have a serious procrastination problem so when I'm feeling fine, I end up blowing a lot of time so I manage to do very little of what would make me feel proud during said periods. Thus I don't trust myself anymore.

&#x200B;

As time goes by, the spark of life has been waning as well. I no longer enjoy music and other activities I used to rely on for hope. Some months ago I still had a will to make my own songs, to record and share them. But now I'm losing interest for it as well as for other stuff that brought me a will to live and a hope for purpose in the past. Anyways, I procrastinate so bad, the desire for doing art or studying would mainly bring me suffering for not being able to commit to the work.

&#x200B;

I don't have children, a spouse, a great career, a house or land of my own, nor a significant impact in this world. My mom would be greatly saddened if I unalived myself. This and my cats are all that keep me alive. It's so painful to live in order to not ruin the lives of other beings. For me it's a torment to think this misery will be the rest of my life knowing it's worsening and that I don't have what it takes to turn the tables of my own game. I've tried it all. Nothing will ever work but unaliving myself. It's time to start selling my stuff online.

I'm too tired to do it anyways, but I still try and it doesn't work. I was looking into pills again, I can't really see a reason not to. Body dismorphia is a bitch.

I'm entirely helpless and anytime I've been happy was just when I pretended that I could be helped. I was already looking into things like psilocybin for depression.

Before you think anything, I should maybe add a bit of backstory. From a young age, starting maybe around 1st or 2nd grade, I was bullied a lot. A good amount of the bullying was because of my weight, as I've been a pretty big guy for years. So, as a result, I struggled with my self-esteem. A lot. I moved from my hometown about 6 years ago, possibly offering a new fresh start. Maybe people wouldn't bully me as much, you know. That's not the reason why my family and I moved, but it gave me a slight spark of hope. That was a bit short-lived. I didn't fit in at my new school, at all. I honestly have never really fit in anywhere. Which didn't make sense to me ever because I've been told all my life that I had a great personality, and this and that and yaddyaddyadda. I never believed it for a second because of that low self-esteem. Settling into our move was very difficult as well which certainly did not help. At some point, I kind of was struggling with suicidal ideation but I never said anything. Until one day. I don't remember the exact context because it never became relevant, but I think I got grounded for arguing with one of my siblings, and so that set me off. I wanted to kill myself. I have no idea why, but I told my parents at the dinner table. Which led to a series of events ultimately ending up with my dad being arrested, DCS (Department of Children's Services) ended up getting involved, I got checked for a broken skull (had a hand-shaped bruise on my head going into the next school day), and a bunch more stuff I never should have had to deal with. I'll spare you the rest of the details and leave you to fill in the blanks. From that point on, I would have episode after episode, getting worse and worse every time, regarding my mental state. Maybe every 3 to 6 weeks I would have one. After that first episode, I was in therapy more or less prescribed by my state. Let me tell you, if you're ever in a situation where you have state provided therapy, I feel sorry for you. It absolutely sucks. Big time. They basically ended up telling me that I had problems, not regarding depression, but that I was a judgmental, selfish, egotistical teen. Which, I know myself pretty well, and I'm none of those things. So, that didn't help me very much. Soon after, given me running away from home and all these other events, I eventually ended up in a mental hospital. That may have been one of the worst experiences of my life. I had already gone through some Biblical counseling through my church and other agencies, but none of that helped. The mental hospital certainly did not help either. Those things are more or less only there for the purpose of keeping you safe while they figure out how much and how many of each medication to put you on. They used group punishment to keep us quiet, the food was horrible, I couldn't sleep, I broke the shower and had no way to fix it, it just. SUCKED. I mean, obviously it's not meant to be a five-star hotel. But surely you're not supposed to leave there feeling more suicidal than you were coming in, right? Well, that's what happened. Fast forward to today. Since then, I haven't had any major episodes or anything. I almost had one when I nearly cost my entire education career for the sake of nicotine and weed. Thankfully the principal had pity on me and worked out a solution other than expelling me. I am forever grateful. But, that doesn't mean anything has changed. I knew that if I tried to kill myself, or do something, I'm not a very secretive person. I'm very bad at keeping stuff in. So, I just repressed my emotions the best I could. I had a new Christian counselor whom I was honest with but never really connected with much. Now, I just don't understand why nothing makes me feel any better. I don't enjoy anything I do but for like ten seconds while I'm doing it. And then that feeling is gone. Zapped out of my existence. I also have no motivation to do anything anymore, my sleep schedule is messed up, I constantly berate myself (not as much as I used to but it's still a common issue), and all this stress from school, work (until I got fired, twice, for stupid reasons I'll save for another day), and other places just won't go away. I've tried everything to make myself feel validated to where I don't want to kill myself: drugs, therapy, counseling, friends, video games, music, etc. None of it does anything for me, especially anymore. I have to keep acting happy because I don't want my parents to be suspicious of me. We usually have good communication but they're not much of a help when it comes to understanding me anymore. So, my question is this. If nothing is helping me, and I've tried what seems to be everything, why should I go on? What hope is there for me? Obviously if I'm asking these questions, I'll still be alive to read them. So, take this as you will. At this point it just seems that there's nothing that will help. And I always have a plan if I do decide to end this useless fight, a harmless one at that. But that doesn't mean I'll do it. So please, give me anything you've got. I'm desperate.

Two weeks ago I was DEEP into a depressive episode (every few weeks I’ll just disassociate, I’ve been like that since I was in middle school) came out on the other side of it only to get knocked back down by disparaging remarks by my family and then got sick on top of that and didn’t leave my room for 4 days. Tonight I got the idea to spring clean! Which I thought was a good idea. At some point I zone out and think “it would be easier for my roommate to clean out her house after I die if I had less stuff🤷🏾‍♂️.” It just came out of no where. The last time I had any active ideation was elementary/high school, being a gay, fat, black boy in the south with a few emotionally abusive family members. I wouldn’t say I’m having any active ideation at the moment but as evidenced by the tears I was holding back when that idea popped up in my head, I must be darn close. I’m just so tired. Tired of living a double life (not out to family) and keeping an arms distance from my mother because of that, no love life, an abusive job (healthcare… must I elaborate?), no life besides working and sleeping for work. I feel like I’m losing my mind and I can’t sustain life like this, and I can’t keep worrying my angel of a roommate when things like that spill out of my mouth. 

As I sit here on the cold floor of my bedroom, drinking wine and watching beyonce😝 I can’t help but think about how this burst of energy to get this task done and the happiness I get from hearing “drunk in love” will, as usual, die off soon and I’ll be back to the miserable person I usually am.

I  am an international student in Canada. My effing aggressive mother decided to ride on my coattails and come with me to this beautiful country.  I have learned to hate the experience thanks to having  this squealing dead weight next to me living in the same apartment. She is a broke ass loser that spends all her time spitting toxic shit while watching gossip TV all day.

Now  I think I have some kind of trauma from watching all the stupid shit  she does all the time (she punches herself in the head, throws things,  screams like a monkey) and all the major blows I have taken from her.

I  feel completely suicidal an hopeless. No pleasure is worth living  anymore for me. I don't give a fuck about anything anymore. Enough with so much bullshit.

I love my  host country, Canada, but I will kill myself on Canadian soil if I don't  free myself from my goddamn abuser (my mother). I depend financially on  my father who pays 20k, as a much more successful professional than my  mom (By the way, I pay 10k with a part time job) a year for my fucking  university tuition, but somehow my mother still claims she pays off my  life just because... I don't know, it's plain stupid.

I swear she has 12+ hours of just watching YouTube fashion videos it’s. It’s like she attached to the thing and you have to basically yell at her just to get her attention. Like please can I just have my mom back when we used to play with Barbies and draw together. Oh boy my oldest sister lets call her Sophie she’s 22 and she has bipolar, which isn’t the problem but she uses that as an opportunity to play the fucking trauma olympics with me. At one point we got into an argument over something petty and I’m not even joking she starts going on about how she’s depressed, suicidal and she, well… she goes to her room to fucking cut herself and show it off like it’s some battle scar she got from fighting a dragon just to get a reaction. Or at one point she stopped me mid sentence to tell me that she was raped. If you ask when did it happen, she doesn’t say, who was it??? Didn’t say, and when she does the story will change every 5 seconds. She does this all the time. The thing is I always want to believe the victim but gosh darn when there’s nothing to believe I don’t know what to do. The reason why I bring up the bipolar is because when you call out this behaviour Sophie will just be like, “well I have bipolar and it’s difficult for be to control my emotions 😿” my guy you just called my mom a c*nt and threw a glass bottle at her for not letting you take her car for a joy ride and you try to kill me by strangling me in my sleep for not lying down with you at night cause you got scared of a scary movie. I’m just trying to graduate high school so I can get a job and cut her out of my life for good, but thats difficult when I don’t even have a safe place to study and just fucking live at either at my moms house or my dads. I swear Sophie is fucking parasite that I can’t get rid of and I starting to think that suicide is the only option because nothing is getting better and I’m stuck.

What if what’s happening to you right now, this shitty thing, is something that was supposed to happen instead of just a random occurrence? What if, instead of being pissed off and only looking at this sliver of time in the 1.2 million seconds of time that you’ve been alive, you look at this as a master class in the trials of life towards making you a more complete person? That what you’re experiencing right now, in this moment, is on the spectrum of experience that every other person, of the 105 billion people that have ever lived, have experienced. So instead of looking at this small stretch of time through the lens of self pity and anger, you view it as a blacksmith: folding the imperfections into the metal to make a stronger steel. That perspective makes these horrible events a perfect thing. Not perfect in that this occurrence is a good thing, but perfect in that without it, you wouldn’t be gifted with this opportunity to be stronger and better for yourself and those around you. Perfect in that this gives you the grit and imperfections that complete a realistic picture of what it is to be human. 
I have experience with such a wide variety of people that I can tell you with certainty that those we view as having “perfect lives” that have never experienced a day of anguish or wanting, are some of the most miserable people I have ever met. Numb and sad and bored and desperate for normalcy because they’ve never so much as had their hands dirty.  Embrace your loss, embrace your pain, appreciate the bad times because with them you have a greater purview of the good times. 
Some 300 years ago Voltaire said we must cultivate our garden, I think what he meant is stop looking outward and instead focus on your little patch of earth. Make it better in a small way that matters to you and find satisfaction in that win. Take a breath. Take a walk. Close your eyes into the sun. Find solace in the small things that you can control and see what tomorrow brings",1680224592.0

It isn’t so much that I have a problem with being alive—I simply, in my ignorance, find being dead more fascinating. 

As beautiful as life can be, I’ve grown bored with it. So much to do yet nothing is ever done, so much to mind when nothing really matters, so much truth yet none absolute… it’s a game that everyone takes too seriously, spoiling it for the rest—excellent graphics, subpar gameplay… Positively nihilistic, I can’t seem to invest myself into anything, because nothing seems real to me. Reality is real enough but not ultimate, a house but not a home. Eastern monks have intuited the unrealness of reality for centuries, quantum physicists have all but proven it, and the only thing I can muster giving a single hoot about is what lies beyond, what is ultimate. 
And therein consists my romanticization of death: morbid curiosity. Apprehension of truth by death. 

I can’t help but wonder what happens when this shitty rpg is turned off? Logic says the screen will just go black, to nothingness. Imagination agrees but observes the corollary that nothingness is the source of all somethingness, as the color black contains all others. One eye sees a closed door, the other sees an open one, and binocular vision overcomes paradox. If the truth is that there is no absolute truth, death still makes one wise. 

Certainty and metaphysics don’t pair well, granted, but I can’t escape the feeling that there is a realer and truer reality beyond this one, where truth, beauty, and love reign over money, material, and illusion.

The video was about a guy talking about how happy would you be if given a million dollars to some other guests on this show. I can't remember all the details. He further goes on to talk about how about 10million or would you rather wake up the next day instead. Shifting the perspective about how happy you were and grateful for receiving a million and that you should instead treat waking up with the same joy. The other guests were amazed at the perspective he gave them and such.  
To me, I began to cry. I broke down. I immediately thought I would still rather take the 10million and would rather die and the funds be passed to family/friends. And even after some longer thoughts I would still choose that option. It weighs to heavily on me now this video because I just can't stop thinking now how broken I really am.

i am only posting here because i don't have anyone else to turn to in real life anymore. my family is very absent due to having to work shit-paying jobs just to keep things afloat (things including myself, who hasn't been able to return to employment since last summer due to mental illness). i am completely alone most days aside from a younger sibling i have no choice but to care for, and being her older (and only) brother i know i am far too ill-equipped to fulfill all of the kid's needs. i can do the physical necessities but little else; i don't have it in me to do much else, because it's already hard enough for me to just get out of bed.

i do not have many people outside of the household that i can rely on, and every time i think i am steady again something unexpected comes and takes that narrow foothold away.

i feel completely lost and trapped in a no-win scenario. if i kill myself, or if i run myself into the dirt and stop getting out of bed, it's all the same--i'd have abandoned my family. and yet, every day i still feel guilty for still choosing to sustain this ineffective life. is it better or worse to just cut my losses and disappear? or let myself keep going until my family watches me slowly break down?

i don't know if i can do this anymore, but every time i convince myself i'm going to do it i just end up waking up and repeating the same miserable day over again.

Context about me:

I have multiple concerns and problems...I see shadow people, hands, touches or hearing voices, but is very rarely, but it happens a lot of me smelling something rotten...but I am the only one seeing, hearing and smelling these things, It terrifies me because I don't want to have supernatural gift and I have this since I was a child. I have trouble with socialization because I get anxious but also I don't have interest of making friends and I feel fine with just my best friend (even tho my therapist said I can't have only 1 friend) and sometimes I'm a bit slow to understand people's jokes or irony, and a lot of times I say things that is inappropriate to that moment but I didn't know + when I try to make friends I always feel like they might be talk bad about me behind my back and they might try to do something to me without me expecting it. I have a big fear of abandonment, I was neglected as a child and I think that might be the cause, and because of that fear and insecurity a lot of times I get with arguments with my best friend. My psychiatrist says I have trouble with anger, my empathy is very low and a lot of times I feel ""nothing"".  
OBS: I don't feel romantic or sexual attraction to anyone, I'm assexual aromantic.

Context about the situation:

A few months ago, I snapped and I got with a argument with my best friend because of my fear of abandonment but to be honest, I don't remember why...a lot of times when I ""snap"" everything is kinda foggy, I feel like I am not me and I can't control what I am doing and I remember very little what happened...and unfortunately, this happened in a short time period after my best friend tried suicide.  
She showed our conversation to her friends group and a lot of them got mad- nobody in there actually knows me and never talked to me, but my best friends was feeling really bad and stressed so she came to them and was showing to them out conversation (OBS: she absolutely regrets today). One of her friends, even after everything got alright (and of course I apologized) this friend absolutely despisse me...which I normally don't care but my best friend vented to me today saying he calls me dramatic and problematic and he talked really bad about me in the group chat before and in an aggressive way (but my best friend said to him to stop). I already knew that this group could be conspiring about me and maybe is a cult, idk how cult works, but, I am 100% sure that this person can harm me especially because this person is very famous on social media and he can easily make a bunch of people torture me and giving me death threats. I am panicking because I don't know what to do, I simply don't want to live because I don't want to be tortured, I know I'm a bad person but I don't want to.",1680215112.0

I don't know what to do. I'm barely functional. I don't want to die, but I'm afraid of myself. I don't see the point in telling my dad how I've been. But at the same time, I feel like I'm watching myself crumble more and more by the minute.",1680214961.0
