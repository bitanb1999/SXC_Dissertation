If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",1679262278.0

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",1572360722.0

39,The last 3 years have sucked.,1,12abgkp,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12abgkp/the_last_3_years_have_sucked/,0,"After Covid hit, nothing was the same. I graduated, had time to do nothing and play video games (which I loved), just had to look for a job. It was all good....kinda.

But then my Dad got fired from his job, which meant that I had to share the TV and that meant less time to play video games. Months after that, he had to go to the hospital because we learned that he had heart failure. So now, he is home all day and does this hacking to clear phlegm, which triggers my Misophonia. Because of that, I'm not able to play video games anymore just to avoid it. My grandmother also click her teeth with her tounge after she eats something, which also triggers my Misophonia mostly.

I decided to go back to college as I wasn't able to get a job, which student loans will fuck me over. The major is interesting and I like having a creative outlet but I'm not passionate about it. Most of my peers don't like me and ignore me. There was even one incident where I embarassed myself talking about how no one really cares and a student had to literally interupt me to get me to chill politely. The few times I tried to form connections in college, they clearly didn't like me.

I have contamination OCD, which makes my life a living hell and I hate touching things and going out. I also not able to go out to see people (if I wanted to) for a date perhaps, to protect my grandmother from Covid. I was touched as a little kid, my mom died a decade ago, and I was basically raped 5 years ago, which all were traumatic events and I am still experiencing and process grief all these years later. I hate sharing things and my family have always said I was self-centered/selfish and that I only think about myself. People have treated me wrongly and I have treated some people wrongly too. I'm fat, pretty average to ugly (but I do have nice eyes, so I have been told), and no personality.

I don't want to say I have depression, but I do feel that I am depressed (I hope that makes sense and I am not trying to fake how I feel as some others do). Everyday, in between moments of joy, happiness, and pleasure, it's full of suffering, sadness, and most importantly, anger. I can't even fucking listen to my favorite FUCKING artist because they lick their FUCKING lips way too damn much and it really annoys me. Or even look at certain people because of their stupid corny ass mean mug/stone face.

And here I am, trying to muster up courage to talk to a girl tomorrow that was really nice to me in our few encounters that we had in 2 different classes. I'd just want to be her friend. Being her BF wouldn't be ideal tbh, although it would be nice as she seems really nice and she is REALLY beautiful to me. I literally even cried tears about if only I was an entirely different person that was attractive rather than......me, like 2 weeks ago.

Nothing will be better. The past 3 years, and by extension, my whole life has been horrible, with some good though. All-in-all, I just want peace. Peace is all I want, and wishing that I was someone else with an ideal life. Like waking up in a cabin with a beautiful song while it's sunrise with the love of my life. I'm not a victim as I know everyone goes through shit and everyone has problems, but my fucking problems are way too much and they aren't going anywhere anytime soon. I have no desire to change or improve my life with no motivation in this life. I'm too weird. I'm too me. Honestly, fuck people. Fuck everyone. But most importantly, fuck me.

I was abused emotional and sometimes physically my entire childhood. I was raised to be afraid and think everything about me was freakish. We moved a lot. 

Even when we stayed at places for a while I made no friends because I was always afraid others would see me how I saw myself. 

Going into high school my dad left. My mom had been abused emotionally the entire time the were together so losing him broke her. She’d take me to school and would buy take out but she did little else. She was basically bedridden. I don’t remember much of this time or most of my childhood. I blocked out a lot of memories. 

I never made friends in high school. No relationships. No going out with anyone. 

I was forced to go into college as soon as I graduated. I didn’t know what to do. I had no choice. 

I didn’t think I could accomplish anything even with a degree. I picked a useless one because I liked the idea of the job.

My whole life up until then I only had my siblings and my parents for company. In a dorm I started to become more depressed. 

I think in sophomore year I started to lose it when I took a psych class and learned about emotional abuse. 

I started to ask extended family about my childhood and they were quick to tell stories. Of me being beat. Of how as a toddler I changed. How one day I was a happy kid and the next I was sad and angry at everything. 

I never said anything but hearing that the few family I liked, the rest are as hateful and manipulative as my parents, saw what happened to me and didn’t do anything hurt. 

It made me feel like I wasn’t worth fighting for or saving. 

I think the first time I wanted to not be alive was in senior year. The person who came closest to be a friend of mine dropped out. I was alone for all of junior year. I had trouble learning anything. I almost flunked out. I cheated on final exams and got caught. I was angry and a dick to everyone. 

I got a lot of sores from lying in bed and trying to sleep when I wasn’t in school. I wanted to not think. I hooked up with a creepy guy on craigslist. Dude totally could have killed me if he was the type. He was a gang member from what he told me. Showed me some terrifying tattoos. He pitied me. He tried to tell me to show a bit more confidence. 


About six years later and I have nothing to show. Dead end job. No friends. No dreams. 

I just am tired. I try to be positive. I try to not let it bother me. I haven’t changed though. I haven’t done anything different. I still try to make things work with my parents. 

I try to be a good brother and I see my siblings are doing well. They have friends. They have pride and dreams. I’m happy for them. 

I feel then moving on though. I see my parents aging. They aren’t much but once my parents are dead and my siblings are grown. I’ll truly be alone.

I’ve always been alone but that realization has hurt me. I want to be better. I try to reach out but I am terrified. I am religious but it makes it worse. I feel guilt. I’m not impoverished or sick but I honestly have never felt that a moment in my life has been worth the emptiness and pain. 

I’m just here. I really wish I wasn’t but I am not the type to end things myself. 

So I’m just here. Unable to asleep and crying again. 

I wish I could stop feeling. That I could get rid of my emotions and hopes for anything beyond food and money. 

I can’t though. It seems I can’t do a thing except change and I’m afraid of doing something different. I fear things could get worse. All things ever get is worse for me.",1680500624.0

They felt overwhelmed by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and exhaustion.

They had trouble finding joy in the things they used to love and had difficulty getting out of bed every morning. They felt stuck and seemingly unable to see a way out of their current state.

One day, this person decided that they were tired of feeling this way. They wanted to make a change. They sought help from a therapist and started attending regular sessions to work through their feelings and develop coping mechanisms. They also reached out to friends and family for support and started to open up about their struggles.

Over time, this person began noticing small improvements in their mood and energy levels. They started incorporating healthy habits into their routine, such as exercise, healthy eating, and getting enough sleep. *They also started to challenge negative thoughts and reframe them in a more positive light.*

Although there were still tough days, this person continued to persevere and make progress. They started to set very small goals for themselves and celebrated each accomplishment along the way. They also found comfort in creative outlets, such as writing and painting.

As time went on, this person began to feel more like themselves again. They were able to find joy in the things they used to love and felt much more connected to the world around them. They were grateful for all the support and love they received from those around them and were proud of the progress they had made.

While the journey to recovery was not easy, this person learned that it was possible to overcome depression with the right tools, attitude, and support. They found a renewed sense of hope and purpose and were grateful for the opportunity to live life fully again.",1680468717.0

I can't even get a job that's a step below what I'm aiming for. Every job is telling me that everything I've done until now has been a waste and my worth is nonexistent. I was just thinking about how long this could go on for. The only reason I'm able to hold on this long is because thankfully my parents are supporting me. It's humiliating that I depend on my parents still. I avoid people because I'm embarrassed to tell them ""I'm still looking for work and just stay at home all day, depending on my parents."" If this lasts longer than they can support me for, what am I supposed to do? When I think about that, I just think at that point the only option is to just off myself. It's not like I have the will to struggle to survive. I don't want to survive. If I'm to exist, I want to live. Surviving serves no purpose to me.",1680497858.0

I've been feeling empty for a quite long time , feels like a hole in my soul that can't be filled no matter what i do. And sometimes it just feels heavy on my chest , like something weighing me down , sometimes it's just anger and extreme boredom that makes me feel like i hate everything around and i don't feel like doing anything and i just want to not exist , and it's an endless loop , same feelings.
My only way to cope with the emptiness and loneliness is daydreaming, everyday about having friends, it's been years since i've been dreaming about them and they became my only source of comfort in this world , but lately even this can't get me to feel something.
The only thing that i currently do in my life is studying, but i can't even study hard like i used too and it just creates more room for stress and anxiety.
I sometimes feel like maybe it's not that serious and i'm just exaggerating cause ppl around me will always be like ""yeah everyone hates their life"" but like i don't think that everyone is going through this disgusting feelings everyday (?)",1680497364.0

Living seemingly for others when really others don't care. the life of loneliness that never ever will go away.

I lost everything that was ever important, I was never able to make things work although my heart was in the right place. I tried, I truly did. I fail at everything, and I have no further need for hoping. I mean, why?  There's no point. I am in my mid 50's. Things don't get better. I am a true loser, I'm ugly as hell, no love in my life. 

I'm not a druggie, just a regular guy, but I was not fortunate to be able to get good things, things to live for. Every effort is just failure, and at this age and point, there just isn't a need anymore.

For the past 5 days, I have overdosed on my blood pressure medication and insulin. I have taken 15-20 pills of losartan, and also taken 100 units of my insulin. Yet all that happens is me waking up fatigued. 

Listen,  I want to die.  I'm no longer trying to find reasons to live. I don't want it. I can't seem to even get suicide attempts right. Already I am eyeing the door that maybe I can use for hanging.

It has to be done.  I don't want to end my day in constant mental pain and relive having nothing to live for, nothing to wake up to.

Everyone says that's what I should want. But most importantly, I'm mentally unwell and everyone says mental illness is inevitable when you isolate yourself.

But is that really, definitively true? I feel I get plenty of socialization by going to the store and just walking among other people. I get it from watching videos online.

Most importantly, whenever I try to interact with others, I get the crippling pain of feeling out of place, and helpless to ever change that.

Every time I try, the pain resurfaces. I try to talk to others, I try to be myself, but I feel rejected. Then I try to be what I think they want, and I feel used. I see a therapist, and they challenge the way I think, but they can't change the way I feel. I try to exercise because they say mental health mirrors physical health, but the longer I stick to it, the heavier the lack of change in my self image weighs on me, until I stop.

I can't see any peace for me without locking myself away as much as I can. Is there really no happy ending possible that way?",1680470464.0

I would love some outside perspectives on this.

I am a woman in my mid twenties and I have a very severe dissociative disorder and depression. Back in November, I was able to break out of the dissociation as I planned a trip to visit my boyfriend who is in another country. We had a great time and since then I have traveled back and forth to spend time with him, with little to no dissociation.

A month ago, unfortunately, I have fallen back into a dissociative state and I know what triggered it. I have not been able to pull out of it, even with another trip planned to see him in a month. I am barely functional. This has been beyond heartbreaking for me as I was so happy to be functional and active for the last 4 months. I am back to being more or less bedridden.

My boyfriend is aware of my history with this. Up until now, I have not told him that I have fallen back as I thought perhaps I could move through it and I did not want to worry him unnecessarily.

I do not know if I should break it off with him. I wonder if it's the best idea for him, or if I am sabotaging it. I don't know. He is, quite literally, the light of my life, and to loose him would be a fatal blow to me. He has been my rock for the past 2 years. It is because I love him that I am contemplating breaking it off. I am crying writing this. I am not functional and I just think he needs someone who is stable.

Well, life really isn't going that great for me, my life is a mess. I'm a nursing student year 1, I've got an addiction to opiods. They are controlling my life, every second of every day I'm thinking about them. No matter what I can't stop I'm so scared that this will cost me everything.

- no motivation to do anything, staying in bed most of the day
- very little sleep. Staying up all night until 7am then sleep till 10
- I've got a skin condition eczema, on the back of my ankle which bleed every day when I wear shoes.
- no appetite, today I have had 2 Yorkshire puddings. I just have this feeling that I don't want to eat. I love food it's worrying me

I am on antidepressants, they have changed my life. I dont feel the same as before when my mental health was bad, I don't think it's that.

So I have officially decided that I need to change, going down the path I am on, I am going to end up in hospital or worse

My plan is to focus on one thing at a time, my addiction is going to be the hardest thing to stop.
I am going to start going to Narcotics Anonymous meeting. Mainly online 

But first I need to tackle my motivation. So tomorrow I am getting up at 8 am I need to force myself to. Go to my dermatology appointment. Then i am not allowed I'm my bed until bed time

I also have a recital coming up this month that I'm ill prepared for. And my grandmother, who is basically senile, is coming to stay with us in a couple weeks for an undetermined amount of time. She's bringing her two dogs with her, so now there's going to be four dogs I have to care for, plus a mentally deteriorating grandmother with a lot of needs.

Over the past few months I've detected a steady decline in my mental health and I think it's really becoming life altering. Anxiety leaves school to be an incredibly draining and debilitating aspect of my life, so in the weeks leading up to spring break I would come home absolutely exhausted and then usually have to go to work afterwards.

I don't work a ton, but I do maintain around 12-15 hours per week while also trying to sustain decent grades (I'm a senior in high school for additional info). It was getting so bad that I would come home and sleep for hours on nights I didn't have to work.

My spring break started last Monday and I've noticed a complete attitude change in myself that I never used to struggle with in the past. For two days I did absolutely nothing. I didn't shower, I didn't practice hobbies, I didn't even get changed. I sat in bed literally all day long and watched shit on my phone. It was like I just had a complete mental crash. Writing this out makes me realize that this is probably pretty commonplace, but it's unusual for me because I literally just started neglecting everything I care about.

Therefore, that set the stage for how the rest of my break has been. I can't get out of bed, I can't clean my room, I can't shower. I literally just don't care. That's literally the only thought in my mind. I don't give a fuck. I try to get myself to do something and all that I can think is, ""Why should I?"" or ""Why does it matter?"". I can't get anything on track and I don't know what to do because I don't care about anything anymore. I don't even know if I ever had a drive or ambition to begin with, I think I was always just ""motivated"" by other people's expectations of me. Life feels too exhausting for me to even bother.

Edit\] I think it's worth noting that in this state that I've been in, it almost feels like I'm paralyzed. I LITERALLY cannot get myself to move. It quite literally feels impossible. Also, before spring break I would get mini sessions like this. I would go into states like I described and then usually fall sleep, waking up and wanting to cry because it would be 2 AM.

I’ve suffered two brain hemorrhages, had my heartbroken twice, lost lives of those that I’ve loved and have gone through serious mental health struggles. I’m 22 and my childhood, prepubescent years as well as teenage years has moulded me into who I am today.

I’ve been studying the Law of Attraction/Assumption and been fascinated in self-love, relationships, the gym, political encounters and religious debates. (Quite an odd mix and match I know). 

But as I write this message, I feel as the 0.1% of people in my circle, orbit and aura of those in my age group and peers as I have experienced such a drastic life up until this current age.

Why is it that I am this way and unattainable to people and to the universe? I’m isolated, lost and stuck. I only have my thoughts and myself. I teach myself positive techniques but it’s conflicting with my emotions and current life situation. I feel hopeless, lost and stuck.",1680481772.0

ignore my Name, this situation wasn't there when I made it.. My best friend has always been depressed, but now it seems like it's getting to the end. She often tells me that She hopes that I'll go to her grave, since no1 else will go. Her family doesn't really support her, they even know how She feels, but they don't take it serious or just do not care, since they treat her miserably most of the time.

I asked her to seek professional help, but She doesn't want too and even if I ask propose to go with her, She just doesn't want too. She doesn't see any sense in life & everytime I try to show her what Life can be, everything seems good for the moment, but then everything starts over again. She once didn't even sleep till 5 a.m, because She was scared to be ""alone"". Sometimes it seems like She's scared of dieing, sometimes it seems like dieing is the only thing that can give her peace..

Should I talk to her about these things, even if She doesn't want too, or do I just show her how life can be, with the hope that She won't do anything? I really can't afford to lose her, She's often the only reason why I can laugh at some tough days..",1680468173.0

26M, live in a big city. Currently w/o work but actively applying everyday. I want to write, so I usually work service/other odd jobs rather than climbing up a demanding career ladder that I’m not passionate about.

I’ve been in therapy for 12 years now and have tried various medications during that time (including now). My last therapist of 11 years retired recently and I haven’t been taking it well, but I’m already seeing a new one even though it feels strange.

I decided to get more fit about 5 years ago and it’s now a big part of my life. I go to the gym and lift 3 days a week, I train BJJ the other 3/4 depending on energy. I’ve taken up piano lessons again after playing for 15 years as a kid and stopping during college.

If I’m not applying for jobs, I like to read or learn other random subjects. I’ve been working on a language for about a year now, I’ve tried to relearn some math (always sucked at it), and obviously I write when I can.

Socially, I try to put myself out there. I have some friends but not a tight knit group. I’ve gone to meetups and other events on my own and feel I’ve improved socially at least a bit.

But since I’m so unhappy there’s this nagging feeling I’m still not doing enough or doing something wrong. I read a lot online how ending up in this position is due to my choices, and I agree to a certain degree, but I really do feel like I’m trying—however, societal feedback makes me feel like I’m doing this to myself and am not motivated enough or that something is wrong with me.

I know it’s probably just a very bad week, something I’ve been through it before several times and will get through again, but I’m in a really bad place right not where it’s hard to see much hope.

She has been battling depression on and off for a good portion of her adult life and seems to be going through a bad patch lately. She has been perscribed adderall for a few years for ADD and hasnt been taking any other meds, but has had a therepist and psychiatrist she has been working with. As of January 2023, she lost both of them due to an insurence change with her work. Its been very hard. We've tried getting her support and she has found a psychiatrist recently and they dont want her to continue the adderall. She also suggested an antidepressant and my GF has always considered, but is hesitant. She finally agreed to try bupropion since she had it in the past and likes the idea of maybe having it mitigate the dopamine changes that may come with coming off adderall and the lack of weight gain side effects. However, she is only on day two and she is losing her mind. She is very unstable right now and I've tried to be there for her and explain how hard it is to drop one med and that there will be mood changes and energy changes, and also that new meds take time time to balance out. But the mood swings she is having right now are some of the worst ive seen her have. They seem to me to be more of a result of stopping adderall than anything else, but I just dont know. I'm not sure how to support her best. She is saying she is giving up on everything and just cant do anything at all. No work, no focusing on anything is possible, says she is sorry but she needs to break up with me because she is so mentally ill and so on and so forth. I know she is struggling and i know its hard to stop and switch meds, and im really trying to be here for her while working full time, but she loses herself when she is home alone, like today. 

Is there any advice or ideas out there as to how i can help her? I feel hesitant to bring her to a hospital, but idk if that's maybe a good idea?

I literally feel like the biggest loser in the world because im turning 20 and i have nothing to show for it.. i have never had any intimate relationship with anybody and I have pushed all my family away and all my friends away and I iterally have nobody in my life that gives a shit about me anymore and its all my doing aswell.

I feel even worse because everybody says ""uni will be the best time of your life"" , but my experience has been the most emotionally harrowing and isolating experience of my life and I feel like I might go insane.  

I started uni in an already bad mental state thinking it would be a fresh start where i could thrive and find myself. But it has been the polar opposite; I immediatly found myself stranded in endless amounts of uni work and after the first few weeks I didnt have any time to go out and isolated myself completely, just studying day in day out just to pass. I quickly realised that I seemed to be the only one finding it so hard and it really started to get to me. The other classmates I had that I tried to connect with were quite reserved and didn't really engage too much but come the end of  year and everybody was out of their shells and found their cliques. It really made me self concious alot and mentally I became more reserved and i started to feel extremely depressed with my parents also giving me alot of resistance from switching degrees and slowly distancing themselves aswell.

During this time i'd still go out with my roomate occasionally since we were friends from school and we lived together so he'd ask me to tag along(out of sympathy). And honestly he was my only support structure. Its sad because the feeling was most definately not mutual.. but he was the only thing keeping me sane while my life was falling apart.

Last week he broke the news to me that hes gonna be moving countries within the next month so im basically gonna be staying all alone in our apartment the rest of the year, and it very much got to me. It was then that id realise that after my roomate leaves there wont be anybody on this planet that gives a shit about me. Im literally just rotting away alone in an apartment studying day in and day out.. with nobody to call and vent to, no texts asking how ive been ,not a single notification, basically not existing on this planet. I just cry and work and repeat just wanting something as simple as a hug or some agknowledgement that i still exist or mean something to this world.

I'm not posting for advice (=please not comments like go get help) I just find it very confusing & unpredictable which makes me constantly self doubt it all though I also experience lack of emotional permeance so when I'm not feeling emotional pain or feeling like I really want to not exist my brain totally forgots how it feels like

I'm a 24 year old Autistic Trans Women

Both my best friends think I have depression, I should trust them they both know me very well & ones bipolar & one has depression

Why aren't I 100% sure I have depression? It feels like it takes a lot for me to go into episodes, though people without don't go into them like that = it doesn't look like situational depression not had anything like a breakup or grief, also sofar my longest was only 6 weeks & as it aged my symptoms grew & got worse than suddenly ended on its own

This year I had a 6 week episode during which I became self-aware of my symptoms & I had more than enough or/& especially as it aged on, episodes last year I wasn't self aware & they might've been less bad

So last year I had a 14 day episode after caused by higher stress following HRT induced second puberty cried a lot all negative emotions & other stress following then I don't remember where it came from, the peak of the episode was either when for 2 days I had intrusive thoughts that scared me or a few days later where I went to friends birthday weekend & was crying lots & mentioned death & my funeral to my best friend

Later built up anxiety (I don't have a anxiety disorder) about my best friend exploded when visiting her in July, that led to me possibly being depressed later that weekend, the anxiety was still there then a few weeks later we saw each other again at a youth international camp because I was anxious I had a talk with her, didn't go well we decided to stop talking a while, it maybe triggered a depressive episode at least 5 weeks, crying everyday & sometimes waking up to cry which led my brain to discovering self-harm not via the internet via my penknife, it didn't work, so didn't start then

Then end of November, I opened up to my best friend (we only didn't talk about 6 weeks) things, conversation was stressful the next day I said something to someone & the reply triggered me then I was in a noticeably depressed mood the rest of the day & went on less intense for least part the next 3 days, in December I got really overstimulated because I'm autistic the day of going to my best friends birthday party & I was still overstimulated when I got there, that turned into being triggered then got distracted by drinking then got annoyed by something I heard so I drank half a bottle of whisky the next day I was kinda hungover then got met with a sudden change of plans with my best friend concerning the next day that changed my mood later really got triggered my brain went to I don't want to be here & I went quiet/non-verbal my friends noticed we played a game that kinda distracted me tho was still really really depressed, it stayed with me to the next day where I really didn't want to exist, then the next 3 days it faded out then a week later I got very anxious from a stressful conversation with my best friend, next day met my other best friend I was anxious making me overstimulated so she ordered for me, then I was alone on new years eve so I got drunk, then 2 days later had a autistic meltdown as got anxious, the next day a 6 week episode started, that episode was slowly getting worse as episodes can then accelerated with stress as me & my best friend had an argument, from there it felt most like depression then I ate chocolate for 7 days which emotionally numbed me then stopped then got triggered again & experienced a few days all day wanting not be alive

I know alcohols a depressant though I think that looks different in people without depression, it's a hangover not anything more & it's never just just been alcohol alone that's triggered me

Since then had something happened a few weeks later that made me really really depressed 2ish days after that became less depressed for 2 or 3 days

Nothings happened since then except earlier this week I had a I really want to d!e moment, I'm starting to think I can be in a kinda depressed mood while not in a episode & that's normal in depression outside episodes, not for someone without, in episodes it's lots more, I don't strongly feel except when depressed & not numb, that's emotional pain & not wanting to exist

Anyway I might have depression a mental illness that flares up during my life as my brain obviously is susceptible though it's unpredictable for me, probably because I didn't develop it between 8-14, my best friend who's known me 6 years thinks it's not new of last year, just went under my radar prior, though she obviously could see things & I found some indication via old facebook messages, understanding my brain is a mystery to me I think of depression as black or white because Autism though I probably do have the mental illness",1680477211.0

I’ve been struggling with depression for a while now, or at least I think I am, haven’t been diagnosed yet, currently struggling to get a hold of a psychotherapist. I sometimes try to talk to some friends about my feelings, cause it’s supposed to help (honestly doesn’t really do it for me, as I’m struggling to even articulate what my problems are) and one thing that they’ve said, probably all of them at least once, is something along the lines of “I’m so sorry you feel like that, but it is important that you know, that it isn’t your fault, that you’re in this situation”.

And I get it (at least I think i do). When I searched this sub before posting, to see if this has been talked about before I found a lot of posts of people who are extremely burdened about feeling responsible for feeling awful and it is important to take that off them as a step towards feeling better. 

But to me, hearing again and again, that it is “not my fault” sounds so depressing, because it seems to imply that I had nothing to say about me feeling the way I do. And I don’t really know, how I would be responsible for my situation, but that’s fucking awful. If there was nothing that I could have done to prevent my situation how do I know that if I get better I won’t be in the same place again some time further down the road? It means that I have no way of controlling my path and if nature decides in 10 years, that I should suffer again, so be it. Ain’t my fault. Thank god.

Is there something wrong with this? Am I making a mistake in my conclusion? Or is it just that fucked?

PS: reading this again, I guess you could see this as a way of me blaming myself and justifying it, but I don’t think it is. I genuinely find it depressing to think of the implications of “it’s not your fault”.

I’m on a Suboxone MAT program and so I have to get counseling and therapy and stuff every week or I lose my meds. Also I’m now freaking dependent on a different substance just one from a doctor that takes a lot longer to come off of than the heroin I was on. So that’s dope. It’s destroying my teeth.

And I love her so much. I get up everyday at 3:30 am and god I’m so tired at times but I’ve built my life around her. To spend the most time I can with her. After 10hr shifts I pick her up and we do homework, etc.  And she hates me. She no longer kisses me, and will throw tantrums at me. Hit me. Everyday she asks about going with her dad. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I really do play with her or try to. It’s getting really lonely.
I don’t have a single friend. I’m so lonely. Ive gone to therapy. It helped only a little. I’m so tired.",1680461892.0

It wasn’t a big thing for me to say no to it. I used to go to university. Work. I was busy. I had a healthy exposure to porn(if that is even a thing). Like interest was there. But it was no addictive. 
Now for last few years, larger plan did not worked out. Peers are cruising ahead with their lives. And here I am just being deserted by someone or something. Now porn doesn’t excite me no more. Nor for many things other. But I still jerk off. I tried to look for the porn clips that I watched in teenage years. It wasn’t same. It was just my desperate attempt to cherish the days that are gone. Fapping is now like a chore. Have nothing to do, go fap. I also want you to know that there were few weeks that I had to be busy and I was just functioning like healthy being. No porn. Nothing. So it isn’t like I am addicted to it. 
I am just bored or tired I guess. Life hit at me so many times. I never sought to write on social media before. Never sought for empathy. Rather I would help others. Hype them up, even on this subReddit. For even 2 day streak. Now I am tired to fight back. I just carried on thinking reprieve is around the corner. I had breathing spaces. But never a happy streak. I worked out. I played outdoor games. I used to draw. I used to play video games. I used to love someone. I used to write stories. I was the last resort for people in my circle when everything fell apart. Now, everyone is doing good so they are gone. I still have good friends. Few of them. But none in my state anymore. 
I don’t even know if anyone would look for this. It’s like almost everyone’s story. Nothing unique in rant here. I am not even looking that this will help. I used every trick. I succeeded most of times. But life happened, every time.

I lead two separate lives. I have a happy, positive attitude in front of friends and family, colleagues included. This is all a facade however, and despite the mental strain it puts on me I have to keep it up otherwise I just end up causing trouble. 

In my private time, I'm the opposite. I'm struggling to find reason for existing. I've been clean for 3 months yet the temptations are stronger than ever, I need some form of release or catharsis, and I can't seem to find it. I feel like my emotions are overflowing, and they're going to make my work life hell. I've already had god knows how many days off work and yet I'm on probation. I don't want to have to go back to job hunting, that was painful enough in itself. 

To add to this, I suffer from anxiety and ocd. I have a particular set of habits that I've developed due to my OCD, and fighting them everyday wears me down more. I feel like the fight was lost before it even begun. 

I am currently seeking counselling, but I am doubtful that is even working, considering I tell my counsellor I feel better each week, which I clearly don't, otherwise I wouldn't be venting here. 

To add to the stress and worry, I'm a single guy and I haven't been in a relationship for 6 years. Let's just say my only relationship was an abusive one, and it has left me scarred. I finally found the courage to open up recently and start trying to date again, yet to no avail. I was almost catfished recently, and that combined with being ghosted by people has left me wishing I hadn't come out of my shell at all. 

Yeah I get that I trust people and I can be gullible, but I just feel betrayed. I don't want to be abused and hurt again, I just want to be happy. I just want to see one shred of normalcy in at least one thing I do. 

It's tiring. I want to give up, but I'm too much of a coward to do anything life-ending. 

At the rate things are going, I feel like I'm a Masochist putting myself through all this extra pain and stress.

In my case.. Losing both my father and mother. Losing a parent/parental figure in our lives seems to be a very common challenge... at least I like to think so..

Being the baby of the family isn't really anything special as some people like to think. We stand at the end of an old marriage couple who had a kid late, had a kid and decided that was it, etc and we endure what is to come when we are just figuring out who we truly are in this life and who we are to ourselves, most importantly. 

I've been depressed for a month now. I haven't worked even though it's literally ONE phone call away. I haven't done much to improve on any hobbies I enjoy and life outside just TERRIFIES me.

The health condition has physically and mentally affected me in a very negative way. I’m not happy with my life at all, I feel horrible.

I’m constantly depressed, I’m not happy and surely my coworkers can sense this as well. I was also meant to go to University a few years ago but due to this health condition I didn’t go.

On Monday I will start with the employer of my choice with much better conditions and actually I should have been satisfied with that.

First of all, I’ve been feeling such a lack of motivation, especially when it comes to my studies.

I will also start studying with some motivation, however after 15-30 minutes I will lose it. However, this is not just a studies problem. I’ve been going out with my friends, but I don’t feel eager to do that as I used to (I’m generally a big extrovert, that’s the thing). I also finally have the time to see all my friends because my exams are over, yet I just don’t feel like it.

Also, I’m having trouble focusing. Whenever I read something, I literally just scan the text, however the text just doesn’t reach my brain and every single sound can interrupt me and I have to re-read the paragraph.

242,Ah,15,1290wq3,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1290wq3/ah/,5,"
I'm losing my fucking mind and I can't stand it.  I feel like I'm not even here anymore and I'm just waiting to die. 

I know it's stupid to some people or it may seem like a shallow and pathetic reason to be sad, but I just can't stand how hideous and disgusting I am, I can't take it. 

The only thing I want is to be pretty and cute but I'll never have that and I can't cope with that fact. 

Everybody thinks I'm a man and look like one. It's so painful to get treated and thought of this way Every. Single. Day. 

Im 6' , have a square jaw, broad shoulders, deepish voice, im flat, and to top it off, all my hair is falling out. I've gone to the doctors and they tried different things but nothing fucking helps. I diligently follow their instructions and nothing. I try talking to a therapist and all that fucking moron says is basically ""damn that sucks""  every week and collects their $120 for 45 minutes of bullshiting me 

I'm so ashamed to go outside and talk to people and have them look at me. Even when im at home and sleeping I keep a hat on because of how ugly I feel. 

And the cherry on top, when I was a teenager I developed and underbite, and I was lucky enough to have my insurance cover a corrective surgery, but apparently I guess my jaw has grown again and now I'm having trouble closing my mouth again.  I can't stand being this fucking revolting. 

I think to myself, ""God, what did I do for you to curse me with this brand of torment"", because aside the mental problems I'm physically healthy, so I feel even more guilt and sadness that I feel the way I do.  And i feel guilty and embarrassed to talk about this because its really fucking hard to talk about your insecurities straight to somebody's face. 

Every time I stand up, brush my teeth, or so anything I'm reminded how hideous I am. And I'm terrified of meeting  new people and talking to people so it's basically impossible for me to feel comfortable socializing. Even my own parents make comments about my appearance (not necessarily mean, but it still makes me upset and ive told them too) so I avoid them as much as I can too 

I've gotten into a bad habit of punching myself when I feel upset. I punch myself in random places as hard as I can or stab myself with blunt objects etc, and I've also started squeezing and twisting my fingers and I'm afraid I'm going to snap them by accident. 

My mental health is just progressively getting worse and I don't even have anything I can distract myself with because nothing makes me happy anymore. I used to like reading, drawing, painting, walking, and other things. But now all I can do is think about things that upset me and I've jsut lost the love for things. 

I said as a teenager if I'm not happy by 25, I'm allowed to kill myself(im 22), but I don't even know if I have thst in me. I don't know what to do, I feel like there isn't anything I really can do. I've been depressed since I was around 10 years old and if I haven't gotten better since then, will I ever at all? 

12 years of suffering by myself, hating myself, blaming myself for all my mistakes and failures, internalizing all of the awful things people say. I'm just a broken toy at this point and i don't know what to do. 

I keep asking myself ""what can I do"" but there's nothing that I can do that will make a difference. You can say ""well surgeries exist ☝️🤓"" like other geniuses have told me... I can't even afford rent, I have no money. It would be bare minimum 10 years before I could even afford one luxury for myself. I csnt wait that long, I refuse to live this way for that long. 

So what does that leave me with? What are my options? What can I do? ""Stay strong"" ""it'll get better"" ""time heals all wounds"" bullshit bullshit bullshit

246,Depressed in engineering school,3,129bvsa,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/129bvsa/depressed_in_engineering_school/,1,"Hello all, 

I am currently depressed in college and am having the worst semester. I started out college as a loser in high school but I got a 1480 on my SAT. My parents were supportive of me and let me study in a smaller less reputable school because they wanted me to get a good education along with college experience. 

My first semester I didn’t do well but I at least had the drive to move forward. My last 2 semesters (year 2022) I lived it up. I weighted 125 pounds, won a scholarship, got a 4.0 for spring and fall and worked an internship at a Fortune 500 company being only 19 years old. As far as my personal life went I dated a man from my neighboring country (I’m Indian) and had a blast with him. He helped me with my coursework as well but then fall 2022 semester ended and he graduated. 

Now I am currently almost done with the spring 2023 semester. I am failing 3/5 classes and I have attendance problems. Whenever I try to study I can’t concentrate and I struggle with the material. I sleep in and I have gained 15 pounds weighing 140 lbs now. My parents are supportive and think I’m smart and hardworking. They are paying for my expenses. However, I am doing terrible in my classes and nothing seems to help. I constantly feel depressed and don’t have the drive to be excited about anything. I haven’t gotten my period in 2 weeks and feel shooting pain in my pelvic area. I try to exercise but I feel tired and weak to be able to move. If I were to fail my classes I would have to wait a year to retake them. I don’t understand any material in any of my classes. If I want to learn I feel like I have to start from scratch in each subject and I don’t have enough time to do so. I have a 3.7 cumulative gpa in electrical engineering just to watch it drop to 2.9. I have a job offer lined up for summer but I’m not excited at all because I still have a year left to graduate and I feel like school is going to kill me before I start. 

I feel like giving up everything all together. I mean I lived my good days what’s gonna happen now.",1680415151.0

249,I don't see any point in living if I'm not getting better in keeping up with my life,3,129bges,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/129bges/i_dont_see_any_point_in_living_if_im_not_getting/,1,"I don't care about my life anymore and all I want to do is be at peace and finally get out everything that's been bothering me in the inside, out there to everybody safely in a understandable way but it's not like everything I do and say matters because my existence makes on impact on nobody and will continue to not affect anybody even if I leave this earth. I had an argument with one my family members about something bad I did but it only because I lack the resources to provide for myself with no one to ask so I depend on my family and its not the first time it's been several times for many years because unfortunately my sibling as well as my parents love hurting my feelings in order to make me feel bad about myself by bringing me down all the time. I feel like everybody looks for how bad I can be than acutally want to see me do good because they want to see what kind of monster I can become. I can't even talk to any of them about anything because they are just like society who likes to judge me, criticize me, offend and make me feel like I'm more trouble than before and make me feel more worse than I already am which leads me to never trusting anybody EVER again because of the lack of loyalty and mercy I don't get. 

My sibling treats me like I'm bad degrading me like  trash like I will never be good enough just like my dad  then they leave me alone like I'm a lost cause like I was never supposed to be the way I am to them in the first place. When I'm around my family acts like my depression doesn't exist and that I'm making it all up in my head because they just want to see if I can torture myself any longer to deal with the bull crap that they pinned against me. Like anger I have this uncontrollable urge to cry because I have hurtful annoying straining on my face every time my eyes cry and the water with the nerves inside it just fills up making my face swell building up pain around the veins inside my face making the outside of it look all puffy and red and then start aching leaveing sores real bad  and I just start streaming tears which I try to hide and blink away because I hate showing my emotions so I fight against them in order to show I strong I am when I'm not. 

I can't even cry but I did and I feel guilty because my sibling doesn't care and it's the same thing with my parent who is the only one I have left who I rely on who should have my back but doesn't care if I cry and if they don't then they won't care if I die either because they don't care about what's causing my depression and is purposely adding to it. I can't discuss negative topics about bad things to people including my very owb family because they are privileged hppy and positive and I'm not. I see why nobody cares about depressed people and think they are just a waste of space because they know hot to feel good and live life and learn to laugh love and appreciate what they have and can do a lot of things they are motivated to do with loving family and supportive friends and don't deal with negative  problems and issues that may come about in their life because they know how to face it, often shy away from and shun it for good.

I have nobody around me that can cope and guide me through that mental disorder that I have so I have to fight every battle in life by myself pretending that I'm okay. My family doesn't care about my well-being and my friends are practically nonexistent in my life because no one wants to make the effort to be with me. I go through life traumatized and abused always being a reject and being made to feel like a burden and then a waste of space and I keep wondering why would anybody  want to be with a girl like me who can't be happy and acutally want to be be productive and keep up with life I findit hard to do keep up with basic things than advanced things because I suddenly feel overwhelmed and and frustrated with what I have go do in order to be alive.

 Some people say depression may not last because nothing last forever and that we are all going to die but what's the point of  being in this life if im going to die cause if I don't enjoy my life that I have now with have the ability to truly be happy then I'm wasting my life on earth for nothing and should not live cause of my life left unlived due to not being better alive then. It's normal for me to self-harm as a way to deal with all my pain cause I don't really care if someone stabs, shoots, or run me over with an object that they can use against me because I no longer have the strength to protect my own life. 

 In order to learn how to live is to learn how to die and once I do that then I won't be afraid of dying in my final moments when I take my last breath when I leave this earth because I didn't want to live and weight of life will be lifted and death is the final relief that will make everything better because every time I live everything is like a dead end to me because being happy is hard and when I'm not happy I can't enjoy life all I can do is be bored with life while desperately trying to keep up with myself just to make ends meet.

 I want to be successful like the people I look up to but nobody believes in what I do as I have been thinking about my passion that can help fulfill my goals, my dreams and my want but even if I work hard in life all I accomplished will be for nothing because nobody takes me seriously that can actually get to know me and love me for who I am in order to support me. All my life I have been a people pleaser always being the obedient child meeting their expectations and getting taken advantage of just to fit in and now I don't care anymore because nobody will ever mess with me. 

Everything I work hard for is dead just like I will be because I'm not prepared for REALITY and it's hurts me so bad because everything that I want cost like an arm, a leg and or an organ to obtain and keep on living but all I have is pure knowledge and even that alone is not  enough for me to survive in order to live. In life I feel like I will never make it no matter how much I try to improve myself and the work I put in to what I create there will always be people that will put me down and never see me become successful and happy and healthy. 

 I have nobody that actually cares about me and have been dealing with depression all my life until now because ever since I was a kid I have been talking to myself and everybody thought I was crazy including my parents but that's what I did in order to cope with the fact that I am alone cause ever since I started talking to people I have felt invisible even though I'm having a conversation with them but every time it ends I go right back to talking to myself because I've been taught to be alone and that I don't need anybody in my life that's why I have so many imaginary characters in my head that are not from this world that nobody knows about because the majority of my life I've been talking by myself several times and then I would be mute in silence and then start again and this has become a habit that I still continue to do so.

 Another thing about me is I started not to care about myself or the lives of people so I have constantly prayed for danger and it's because I can't cope with the way life has been to and I have social anxiety and I know for sure that I completely got over it but I guess I didn't. Every time I talk to people I don't know how to speak to them in a good pleasant way but then I think to myself that I speak just fine but the reason why nobody wants to speak to me is because it's either things the that I talk about, my tone of voice or my my sudden change in my mood even though I many not always think I'm moody. I do cry a lot especially in times when no one is around so I can suffer in my sorrows alone but then I laugh too much then giggle little by little and smile a lot like some crazy psycho and this happens so often like some kind of mood disorder that I find that I can't snap out of because how life is to me and people think I'm always fine when I'm not.

 I feel like people get bored when they are around me and I don't want to be around me either because I can't stand myself so much that I wish I wasn't myself at all, I wish was someone else that could have my life but a totally different one. Someone who is perfect happy, loving, charming, grateful, rich, and popular and fun to be around who actually loves to work and has a lot of great supporters with family and friends around. 

Not a total drag like me who is contributes nothing in society with depression that practically everybody ignores and that I'm forced to deal with this mental disorder myself while striving to be happy-go-lucky and be productive self sufficient in abundance and produce content that contributes well to to society. If someone else replaced me and had my family I wouldn't have to exist and be such a burden and useless degenerate that has no value whatsoever and that would be good even though I'ma beautiful kind person who loves my passion and do things for people because I'm the best person you could ever meet but it turns out I'm the worst and I'm not getting any better. My depression makes other people think I'm in poverty that every time I'm around people I depend on them even though I don't trust them with the thoughts and feeling go around in my head as well as my problems and issues and avoid asking for care and help like I always do.

 My depression makes me have no compatibility with other people which can't relate to me in which they give me no compassion, affection and respect from them at all just plain abuse and negligence and betrayal and manipulation, with the ability to take advantage of me just to benefit themselves. My depression makes my health suffer and the ability to lack motivation to do tasks including my favorite things and avoid talking to people because I will just be setting myself up for failure reminding myself that I have no friends and family and that soon I will have no resources to make a living off of because even my depression thinks my life is not enough no one care about me know that I'm only human with one life to live that I'm willing to throw away and let go like a disposable waste that I am. I can't escape from my mistakes and my ability of doing things slow while being left behind all the time so changing the person that I am is could be arranged but when it comes to doing risky unspeakable things that I want to do to myself and to other people I don't change when it to the darkness I feel inside.

I don't think I can live until I get old because all I do is work, stress out, get exhausted from lack of sleep never get happy and eat very unhealthy being a young person is good it won't last and I'm certainly not looking forward to the future. 
 I'm sick and tired of living when I'm feeling dead inside the thrill of death looming closer feels great and is highly ADDICTING, I know that nobody wants me to die but nobody is encouraging me to actually want to live my life so instead everybody including my family is expecting me to die so they can finally react and do something when it will be to late besides I will probably suffer from epic burnout out and then lie down helplessy unconsciously in such a lifeless because I have taught myself to tolerate my own pain for a VERY long time and I will finally be at peace and there will be no me again and everything that had been plaguing me from life will be OVER.",1680413943.0

Putting you into context, I've recently completed the courses for med school. I should be happy, right? Well, I'm not.

In all 7 years that I've been in this career, there has been some ups a downs.

First, you gotta know that I'm in a third world country. That means that the healthcare system is awful. In the last 3 years of the career, you must complete your studies along with what they call ""practice"", in public healthcare centers. Without going into detail, it's kind of a slavery. I'm not exaggerating. 

On the other hand, there has been some things that made this worse, like the pandemy. And that's because I got my prime state as a med student in third year. Like really, I was destroying everyone in knowledge. But the next year, coincided the beggining of the practices with the pandemy. So we stopped all, because we could not be in healthcare centers anymore. 

That year, we did nothing. So there was no responsability to study (yeah, my bad). The next year we continue the career even if Covid was still there. Things never were the same. The combination of the bad lifestyle in practices and the poor study made me a mediocre student.

That was very depresing, cause I got such bad grades in comparison with the other students, like if they were not affected. I lacked motivation

What's more important is that, through the years in this career, I've met lots of people. Generally, I simpatize with people. I considered some of them like real friends. But now, in the very end of this, I realized that I'm alone.

We all completed courses and we made an informal celebration on the central campus. Nobody asked for me and I was not part of that. Yeah, I greet some people, but I was not part of their lives. I just saw how everyone was enjoying themselves in groups, but I hadn't one.

And It's always been the same. I don't have friend who I can talk when I want to talk of something, I'm not into something romantic (even if there were situations to make it happen), and nobody cares about my life.

I don't know whats happening. I'm a really good guy, but nothing seems to work. Do I have to look for help? I'm just not feeling anything.",1680418542.0

Even when I have an interest or hobby I still don’t feel any sense of fulfillment. I don’t like the area I live in and almost everyone around me extremely pisses me off.

I can’t seem to find any other jobs or careers. My parents attitudes don’t make it any better either, it’s like they act like they’re doing me a big favor by paying $10 an hour. At times I hate humanity and all that it stands for. All this stupid shit is meaningless, we shouldn’t be so goddamn controlled by money and objects. We should be out in nature sharing the land with animals and other people, you know enjoying life if that’s even possible.
Sometimes I feel like everything around me exists just to fill me with anger and make me depressed.
It’s like my whole life has just been 
“let’s get this over with”.

  I’ve only ever cared about nature, love, sex, drugs and music. They make me feel better. I wish I could have my own band or make a movie or something but it seems pointless to even try cause I never stick with anything. I find hobbies and other things I like but then I lose interest within a week or two. So I view it as pointless to even try. 
It would be amazing if I could have my own farm, work with nature or even work in a random park but those simple things seem impossible at this point. It’s like jobs like that don’t exist around here. 

  The way I feel is funny because I have a loving girlfriend, a family that loves me, friends that care about me but I still feel alone inside, it’s pathetic.
I don’t tell them about my feelings anymore because I don’t want them to feel bad and usually if I do tell them I’m met with judgement and ridicule so who cares anyway.

263,I need to open up about something....,2,129cdaw,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/129cdaw/i_need_to_open_up_about_something/,1,"
I have been super depressed lately. I have had depression for years and it it hurts. I rarely have a day without sadness. On top of this, I am in engineering school and my workload is so gruesome. I would take time off but I really can't go home and I want to graduate. I'm have a lot of trauma and it runs in my family. 4 years ago, my cousin and friend killed themselves. My Grandma died and I hardly even called her and I regret it immensely. Then, a few days after my 20th birthday, Jason David Frank died and he is one of my favorite actors from power rangers. Now, this bothers me because Power Rangers was one of the very few positive things that I had as a child. I used it as a safe haven from my traumatic childhood. I literally would cope by watching kids shows. So, when he passed away, it was like I lost one of the few things that shield me from pain. (I hate talking about this because I don't want anyone to assume that I am delusional). This was a symbol of freedom and joy in my childhood, so when he died, it hit hard. The worst part about it is the manner in which he died. That is hard to accept. I know that at the age of 20, one might think ""grow the hell up"", but in a way, his death symbolized the end of one of the many few positive things that I had in life. I miss the few happier moments of my childhood. Largely because, I wasn't suffering and people that are now gone were still here. Especially my Grandma. The thing that frustrates me about her passing is that she probably died due to medical negligence in the nursing home (during COVID so no family visits). Apparently she vomiting and choked on her vomiting. The idea that she probably suffered is agonizing. My Grandad may or may not have cancer (he won't tell me) and this scares me because he is 61 years old. That in itself is scary. He is the only father figure that I had.

I have had many mental resilience speakers speak to me, so I get it, see the good. But god dammit if I haven't had the worst luck in terms of timing and now I'm going for a career that almost guarantees me never having a real relationship. Actual fucking support in my life that frankly I need to hear because the only thing I hear constantly is dont join the military, get your degree, finish school, why dont you make something of yourself. Or one ex gf in particular telling me I'm everything I dont want to be as a person. She got it fucking bad but good, Id rather have been hit by my dad. at least I could stand up to him at a point. But she had a family that took the time to help her grow. I had me, myself, and I, after my grandfather died. I had fucking nobody. No dad there at all. The only good, I mean really good memory with him was flying a kite when I was 4. Every memory since has him being hurt or hurting others in some way. Oh and a mom who would go through manic episodes due to menopause with no support but a 12 year old son, a shitty diet that ruined her health and well being, forced me to be at her company events, rather than going for a sport or being social when I was a kid because I knew how to work a fucking projector. 

I'm ranting at this point. But what I'm getting at is that I have had so many people close to me, not be there. I haven't had anybody be there consistently and haven't felt anybody actually give a shit and listen because I cant trust anybody. They either leave to do better things leaving me behind, or become so sick or mentally checked out I cant have a genuine conversation with them. 

The last person I dated was when I was 20. 3 years and 9 months ago actually. It's weird to even say that I loved her, but I did. And she broke it off. Cant blame her. She was on her senior year of college, and now she's studying turtles in the Caribbean for her masters degree. I've made my peace with it, but it had me messed up for a long time thinking I did something wrong when I didn't. The timing, our last experiences, etc would've all made it break down in a ridiculous fashion. 

And thats where I start with my date today. Last night we actually hung out at her house. Went there because she planned a party and only a couple people showed up so I went. Absolutely beautiful person. Easy to talk to. Not crazy sparks or anything, but its also been 3 years. I dont know wtf I'm supposed to feel anymore, but it felt good to just get out. The fucking problem. we had matched twice in 2021. I moved out of our city in DEC 2021. We matched again when I came for work which i do monthly. and I cant help but just think of the dates. Like what are the chances that everybody I can connect with in an emotional level will be either leaving or i'm leaving, or we never dated but when i see them and talk with them it really is ""frankly perfect in my first relationship"".

It just piles onto everything. and frankly thats the only thing right now. Maybe I'm not over and need help to deal with past traumas, but I dont think I can. This is a burner account for a specific reason. The job I'm going for has so much fucking stigma towards mental health support that if you end up going, you cant do your job. Say bye bye to a career where we pay well over a million to you over 10 years and spend a million on training you for your job. But I've got to do it. I'm blessed with the health for it, and blessed with at least being smart enough to do it. And its one long fucking road and I dont know if i have the strength to walk down it along. I'm fucking terrified, and I dont want to feel scared, because I know I shouldnt be, but with whats coming and what I'd have to do if I do what I want to I'm going to be, because I'll die, my friends will die. and I know that I wont have anybody to remember me, besides a few friends who I wouldn't have seen in years, they cant make my funeral because its now in this state, so they just say rip on social media and talk about me on discord for 5 minutes and thats it.",1680428116.0

Hi all, I’m not sure who to go to about this but basically after talking with my psychiatrist she recommended I stop taking Wellbutrin. Essentially, I was doing okay at 150 mg and when the dose was doubled to the therapeutic amount, 300mg, I suddenly felt like my tinnitus was getting louder after a couple days, but I wasn’t sure if I was imagining it or not. I guess I’ll describe it like so: before, I only rly noticed it when I focused on it and it was quiet. Now, it kind of feels like it doesn’t have to be quiet for me to notice it. I went to a concert a few months ago, and for the first few days after the concert it got much louder (or maybe noticeable is a better word), and that’s kind of like how it feels rn. I have a habit of being paranoid about medication side effects so it really could be my anxiety (I have anxiety/depression). The thing is, after being instructed to go back to 150 mg, it seemed like things were getting better until this morning. My tinnitus was pretty loud, and it’s usually in the past it was really mild (esp bc it sounds like brown/voilet noise). Now that I’m trying to sleep though, in complete silence, hours after I took my dose this morning, it seems to be a little quieter, but again this morning I was a lot more anxious so could it be that? I feel like I’m invalidating my own symptoms but idek if they are real haha. I don’t really have much experience with tinnitus bc I never rly knew I had it until one day I realized silence wasn’t supposed to have a sound. The other issue is that I can’t get on any new antidepressants easily because I’m currently visiting another country for a while, and already got a longer supply of Wellbutrin. I’m pretty high functioning though, so maybe I can get by? Anyone have similar experiences ? It’s been about 3-4 weeks since starting.


I also am not really sure that I am depressed enough to warrant medication. I haven’t ever been suicidal or wanting SH and it’s really just been a recent thing, started after I got anxiety out of no where 6 months ago. I haven’t even tried consistent therapy (started mostly with school counseling) and the first thing my psychiatrist did was put me on antidepressant, but I feel like i was thrown into them. I truly think that the cause of my depression is not knowing how to cope with my anxiety and school.

Knowing that we would have to go paycheck to paycheck my fiancé and I cut out a lot of hobbies to save for our wedding/honeymoon. In the middle of this we accidentally got pregnant.. (birth control misshape) it was a shock because first she was on birth control and second we wanted kids maybe 3-5 years out. But you know what I took the blow and kept pushing, I dialed back on our honeymoon so we could start saving money for the child. To add to my never ending money problems I ended up getting a loan just to have the wedding, I sadly couldn’t get as big of one that I wanted because my credit was/is crap. 2 weeks after getting this loan the day care my fiancé works for fired her because in their own words she was too nitpicky about how some employees weren’t following certain daycare rules and didn’t get along with her manger. They sent her a message at 10:49p.m. terminating her because “it was in the best interest of everyone involved.” Without ever getting a written warning bam just fired a pregnant woman trying to prepare for the next step in their life.

276,Is it possible to reset?,2,129ayyp,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/129ayyp/is_it_possible_to_reset/,3,"For me it seems that my depression comes from anxiety, and anxiety comes from a fear of not ""already being where I should be."" I believe this may be caused by genetic factors but triggered and exacerbated by the circumstances around my teenage --> adult years. 

For context I'm 33 M. I was homeschooled in my life. My parents split when I was 5, dad is a special ed teacher and used to be a pro musician with some success. Mom is uneducated and has low self esteem. Mom remarried neuropsychologist, dad was absent. Mom divorced psychologist when I was 15. Then immediately started dating another guy and decided to move in with him ASAP, I begged her not to as it was too much transition but she chose that over me. I went to a couple years of public school but dropped out and got my GED because I was too depressed. Moved out when I was 18. Worked some random jobs-- vintage store, butcher. Practiced guitar. Took some bs community college courses. By 21 I started a band, ended up touring the country with fair success but it didn't continue to build. I had Quit my jobs and lived cheap during this time. Did that til I was 26/27. Band started to dissipate as everyone was tired of the road. It was a good time sometimes but I had cyclical depression and always felt like I was an imposter, and trying to ""be a musician"" sometimes felt like it was killing me. I spent some time at my dads house once that band dissipated and I just relaxed and painted and played music and ate well and I was no longer depressed. I met a guy who wanted to play this super niche style of music I was into and bam all the sudden I had a music project again. Did that for 2 years hard. Played 300 gigs (corner of restaurant ""blue collar"" musician gigs) in 2018 and was totally burned out although I did make a lower middle class living doing it. Super depressed I was looking for an escape and somehow found a friend who got me in at a small tech company testing software. Which despite having no degree or experience I somehow was good enough at. That got my confidence back up and freed me up from the pressure of ""being a musician."" 
But after about 6 months I started to long for my own thing and began working to book more gigs and develop my career. By the end of the year I was dying trying to gig all the time and work at the company. Then Covid hit in 2020 and I got laid off and lived on unemployment. With the goal of taking my next music project forward I came out of the pandemic swinging and recorded an album and released it and played all over my region -- festivals clubs etc -- had the best possible 2022 it could've been. Then it was over and winter came and I was depressed again. The idea of continuing trying to be a musician when I go thru these depressions is sickening cause I know I won't consistently do a good job and eventually I'll be bitter. 

Anyway I'm ranting telling a snapshot of my life story-- but all of this to say-- I feel as if I've been running in a sort of survival/fight or flight mode for most of my teen and adult life. I've oscillated between periods of extreme focus and energy and productivity --all based around the idea that if I worked hard enough I could get myself to be a ""successful"" (examples: as a musician that meant to have a team of folks that kept my career on track and I could just perform, and be making 60k + a year and be adored and loved because of my abilities etc.)  -- and period of absolute low self esteem, hopelessness and ""why have I chosen this path I don't even like music"", a soul crushing depression and anxiety cluster that makes me want to not exist. Also to note it's not even fully about the money -- it's like I don't enjoy the music anymore and music is a life consuming vocation when you feel the need to not be broke which I do. I'm not doing bad considering : I have 35k in a Roth, 25 k in a brokerage, and around 60k in cash saved. But I don't feel like I have a life. When I'm loving it I'm fully focused on music and when I'm not I'm desperately trying to find some way to escape.

That's where I am now. I'm on meds and all that too. But apart of me is wondering if I quit my life, go back and live at my dads house where there is always healthy food and nature, get a really good exercise routine going and  stop this insane hustle I've been in, then once im recovered calmly go get an education in a field that interests me and would allow me to make decent money and then get a job I feel qualified for and more or less integrate into society in the normal way-- would I cure this awful anxiety and depression that surrounds the uncertainty of ""my place in the world "" and stress of trying to make money as a musician and set me up with a more sane and structured life? Or would I probably be just as depressed and sad doing anything once the stress / pressure of any job or school came back --no matter if I took time to try and reset my nervous system by taking all the pressure off-- then I'd be like ""fuck why did I walk away from the cool music stuff I had built?""

It seems that whenever I get really depressed, my emotional support dog wants less and less to do with me the worse I feel. I guess that’s just a reminder that I’m not really lovable and probably am better off gone for everyone else’s sake. My mom is fighting cancer and somehow I’m still stuck here fighting this desire to die, even though my mom is fighting to live. I wish I could be the one with cancer so she could keep helping people and I could get out of her way. She’s loved by so many people, and I’m just her broken son who is loved mostly by association. If I just had my dad I think the world would see me for the pitiful failure I really am. I certainly have a lot to teach about potential. It’s not really potential unless it can be wasted.

The only wall that she always hits is that nothing she does makes her feel good or motivated - she has goals and desires, but that doesn't give her any drive. If she accomplishes something, she doesn't feel good about it. **And she does not know why**. This is the most frustrating part to her - she says she hates herself for being stuck like this, she would like to just be able to do things without feeling miserable about it. It doesn't seem to matter what kind of activity or task it is, no matter the difficulty or duration, there is no positives for her (and as I said - she is very analytical, she knows the objective gains she gets from achieving some specific thing, but that does not help her in feeling any different about it). No approach, no therapy, no medication so far was able to change this fact. So as she says, the only way she ever managed to do anything was to try and push through (""forcing myself""), sometimes even for months (e.g. things like exercise, which therapists like to suggest), and the only thing that ever happened was that the burden got bigger and bigger until she reaches a point of crashing. **This constant contradiction she is experiencing, of wanting to do something but at the same time feeling an absolute reluctance and misery before, during and after** doing it, it's destroying her.

So by now, she barely has any energy to even keep trying. The fact that nothing so far improved anything and her situation only worsened over the years is of course aggravating it even more. Medications she doesn't want to keep trying, at the risk of suffering from side-effects (like a recent one potentially having caused a few months of tinnitus). Clinics she doesn't want to go to (some already told us that they can't really do more than what we already went through anyway) as it would be an even bigger burden on her mental health and that it may very well be ""the last straw"". Therapy she is still going through right now, with a private therapist, but also here she is forcing herself to do so.

She knows the ""objective"" reasons why being alive or continuing to try would be desirable, but it doesn't motivate her to do so. As she said, even if there is a guaranteed solution to her situation (which by itself is already not a thing), something like ""do this for the next year and your problems will be solved"", she doesn't know if she would be able to do it.

* Does anybody here have some other ideas or approaches in terms of therapy or medication, that could relate to this deep-rooted lack of motivation & pleasure and reluctance against everything, that spans over more than a decade? Did you maybe have similar situations, and had something that helped you?
* How can I support her better? In terms of activities I try to make things as easy as possible for her (researching treatment options, handling her doctors and therapists, etc.), but when it comes to this purely emotional side, I don't know what else I can do more than just ""being there for her"", listening to her and trying to be understanding of what she is going through. For example when she asks things like ""how long do I have to keep trying?"" or ""I feel like I should just give up and die"" I don't really know what to say. It feels whatever I could say it would just end up as a hollow phrase. I understand that she is desperate and feels hopeless (I mean, the different psychiatrists we went to also don't have a clear plan anymore and just suggest to keep trying things to see if something helps, so it's hard not to feel hopeless). I can tell her about her goals and things she wants to reach, which angers her because she is aware of those things herself. I can tell her that if we keep trying we could find something that helps her, leading ultimately to the life she wants to have, which frustrates her as she sees it as an unfair gamble ""keep on suffering for a sliver of a chance to maybe, at some point, feel somewhat better"". She compares it to a terminally ill cancer-patient that is rejecting treatment even though there is a chance it may help. As mentioned before, she cognitively is aware of all those things, so I am unsure what I could even say.",1680423519.0

I keep on self destructing. I don't see a future ahead of me. Life has changed so much that it feels like I don't have control over anything. Even finding a new therapist and yoga instructor to try to take care of myself mentally and physically is leading me to nowhere due to language barrier. My spouse will help me with that when they are back but due to unforeseen events we don't know when that may be.

I'm afraid I will completely self destruct before getting the chance to get help. I'm having the worst BPD episodes of my life really. The disorder was kind of dormant (though I've struggled with it for years) until life events triggered it in the most aggressive way. I keep on self harming. It's like seeing myself becoming nothing and there's nothing I can currently do about it. My depression got worse also. I just seem to get worse after I get a tiny better.

Hi guys, I live in the west coast of USA so yesterday at 9 P.M. I had to check our mail which is located right outside our house. I was with slippers and socks and a flashlight checking the mail and while I was checking the mail, I felt a stinging sensation on top of my foot. I looked down, did not see anything nor hear anything, just the night and the silence.

2 min later, I went inside and decided to look at my foot and noticed a little red dot, like a pinprick and redness, it started to itch and burn. It hurts when touching that place. Now when I look at it, that location is a little bit peeled off but no blood, nothing like that. Boom, my mind went straight to bats and rabies and now I am scared that a bat came, bit me on my foot and left without me noticing.

I was sober, awake and veeeery aware of my surroundings. Did not see or hear a bat, never even seen one in real life, only with pictures.

Why is it wrong to commit suicide if it ends my suffering? Because it’s “bad”? Who decided that? 

I don’t have goals. I don’t have interests. All I want to do is minimize my suffering. Every time I find something that helps, people tell me to stop without providing any actually alternatives, or at least ones that work.

For example, I don’t like being around people. I don’t enjoy talking to them. Why should I force myself to? Why shouldn’t I isolate? I am not harming anyone.

They say, “go get help” and “talk to a therapist.” And I’ve done that. For like a decade+. And you know what? It’s done jack shit. I’ve tried. I really have. The reason I believe what I do so strongly is *because* I’ve already done years of treatment.

Growing up I lived in a strict conservative Muslim household. Nothing wrong with the religion, but the culture that stemmed from it ruined my upbringing. I grew up in an Arab community in America, but as a girl who was half white half Arab. Combined with my father keeping me as sheltered as possible, I was bullied and ostracized in school for my identity and lack of social skills. I also had to endure physical and mental abuse from my father, and verbal and mental abuse from my step mother that he brought into my home. I struggle to make friends irl even now, but every where I go now people seem to like me at the very least. At 17 I met the love of my life. I had relationships before but this man was my soulmate. When you know someone's the one you just know. He treated me like I held the whole universe in me just for him. An escape from reality. I finally felt like I belonged somewhere. I had a hope for the future. I'd sneak out of home just to go see him. I was never happier and never more at peace than I was with him. In Janruary of this year I had to run away from my home because my relationship with him was discovered. However, I didn't mind much. I was finally able to move in w my mom in a non toxic environment and plan on moving in with my boyfriend. Life was finally starting to look upward. We were obsessed with each other, so in love. I never could have fathomed him dying exactly a month later. I had a premonition the night before he died. However, I only prayed over it and didn't want to expand on my overthinking. Usually I would stay awake to call him on the way to work but that night I took sleep meds to sleep. Of course. The next morning within five minutes of leaving his home he died. I have his last words in my phone ""she sleep."" I SHOULD have been awake. I could have stalled him from leaving his home. Of course this death isn't my fault, nor was it his. He could not escape his death. It's like the universe prepared me for his death, and its like it was planned. It feels like a sick joke is being played on me. How could I have expected a happy future. He was my key to my dream future and he's my dream man. No one could ever love me as much as he did. I've already gotten three signs from him, idk if you guys believe in life after death but I do. Even if the signs weren't real, there just has to be. This trauma everyone goes through has to be worth something. Anyway, now I'm stuck in this constant state of derealization. This has ruined my life, and please don't tell me there's no where to go but up because I just have no desire to live anymore. This sucked any hope I had out of me. I'm going to visit an evidential medium, to see what the fuvk is going on in my life. Even then tho, he's still dead in another world and I'm stuck being alone here. On top of all the other trauma I've faced, I can't help but feel like the universe or some weird shit has put me on a ""don't kill yourself challenge."" I'm really only here to save my mom the trauma that his mom had to go through. Everyday I wake up with voices in my head. I've suffered through traumatic nightmares from his death. I'm just so done and so tired. All my days since his death have blended together. So many people tell me ""You're so strong"" and ""you got this"" but I truly have no interest in playing this role in life. I thought I did everything right. I'd pray every night to protect this man and to let me spend the rest of my life with him. I'd struggle through everything as long as he was ok. No amount of prayer could've saved him. I always expressed my gratitude, I always knew I was so incredibly lucky and despite whatever I was going through I knew I was still at an advantage in life. Now I just spend my days in my room by myself severely depressed. The emotions r so intense I can hardly leave my house anymore. No amount of therapy is going to be able to save me from this.

318,How?,2,12941r4,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12941r4/how/,0,"Just like the title says. How?          
How are you supposed to deal with depression?            
I've technically been depressed my entire life, never felt happy, or satisfied, or... good, really. But then early last year, someone came into my life, and she changed it completely. And I was happy. Hell, I was ecstatic.          
For the first time ever, I was getting through every day because I wanted to, I was thriving, and i wasn't just getting through the days because I just felt that I had to.             
But me being, well... me. I screwed up. She began to slowly pull away, she was constantly busy. Even going on to neglect her physical and mental health. And it worried me, so I reached out more to make sure she was alright.          
And she always responded, she put everything aside to talk to me every single time because she knew I get severe anxiety if I'm left alone. But the thing was, I actually got anxiety because of her. Like I said, she stopped eating, stopped showering, stopped sleeping. All to make sure she didn't fall behind on school.         
But she still dropped everything to make sure I was OK. And I never managed to tell her that the only reason I got worried, and anxious was because of her...            
And when she did this, she fell behind, so she neglected herself more, so I worried more. And even when I didn't say anything, she somehow knew. So she still dropped everything to make sure I was OK.          
And I always tried to do the same. But we just both kept getting worse. And yes, it was because of each other, but I didn't care.          
I just wanted her happy. She was my best friend. She even introduced me to all her friends, and her sister. Hell, she even introduced me to her girlfriend/significant other (nonbinary, although I believe biologically female. Idk, I never asked because I don't judge)           
But it was obvious that the way we were doing things... it just wasn't working out.           
Then on the 8th of February, she confronted me. Well... her sister did. Told me the way our friendship was going wasn't working. My friend was there too, and I could tell she was upset about it. She didn't even want to talk about it. But her sister forced her too.        
She told me that she was barely able to go through each day without worrying about me mentally breaking down (which was definitely exaggerated... although I do have pretty bad panic attacks) and that, on top of her 5-8 hours of homework, it was too much.         
So I offered to end the friendship right then and there. And no matter what, I would have been able to remember her as someone I loved, and as someone who loved me.  (I would like to clarify that it was platonic love)        
And even if that would have been the end, I would have accepted it and moved on. But she said no. She refused, told me it would be fine. Said she was keeping the promise she made to me that our friendship would be forever.  And I believed her. That promise was promoted by me making a similar one, telling her that as long as I can still breath, I would always be her friend. Sounds weird, but her father left when she was young, and it completely f'd her up.        
So we compromised. As long as I didn't text her on the weekdays when she was busiest, she would check in on me over weekends to lmk she was OK.       
Well, fast forward to Monday, February 12th, I hadn't texted her, and she never checked in. So I sent her a text asking if she was OK. Technically breaking my side of the agreement, but so had she, so I was worried.       
An hour later, no response, so I texted again. 30 minutes later, still nothing. So I texted her partner. Still nothing. By then I had heard from a mutual friend that she was fine. So my anxiety went away.      
I just thought that she was taking the break seriously. And that was perfectly fine with me. She had finally learned to stand up for what she needed, and I was happy for her. She had learned to put herself first for the first time since her father left.       
But then, later that day, I get called up to the schools front office. She filed what was basically a restraining order. Claiming that I had broken the agreement between us.       
She texted me later that day to clarify.        
Saying that as soon as I got help, we could try again as friends. But as we were, it was a broken friendship.         
And she was right, it was. But she broke my heart. That wasn't just her choice to make, telling me that I had to get professional help if I wanted to have friendships. And because my only friends were also her friends, and with the ""restraining order"" Saying absolutely no mutual contact, I lost all of them too. I can't exactly blame them, they've known her for many years, and they only knew me for one. But I still lost everyone. My entire support system.           
And I don't know if I can go on any more. Even if we do fix things, i don't know if I can trust her. Yes, she was willing to (mentally) hurt herself for me by always putting me first. But then she lied to me. And idk what to think anymore.        
I trusted her with my life, she was my better half, my best friend, the embodiment of every bit of good I saw in humanity, the reason my sun shined just a little bit brighter every day. Yes, we had issues, not just with each other, but I would have given everything for that friendship. But then she left, she didn't just bring the extra light she gave me with her, but she put my sun out completely.           
I know people say ""it's better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all"", but I just don't think that's true. The hurt of the loss is the worst pain I have ever felt, and it gets worse by the day.         
And I listened to her, I got real help. Even started therapy. But it wasn't enough. My body literally tried to give up. It started rejecting all food, and I nearly starved to death. I've lost 40 lbs even after going to the hospital for it. I spoke to several therapists at the hospital, and I was told numerous times that the only way I can get better is to talk to my friend. And to fix things.         
But I can't. And even if I could, I don't know If I... well, could. She lied, and he'll, maybe she had a reason. Maybe I really don't deserve friends. Maybe I don't deserve to get better. Maybe I should just continue to let myself get worse until my body eventually decides to just give up. But I don't know.     
Maybe she does care, maybe she actually thought this would help me. Or maybe she just changed, and she isn't the person that I loved anymore. And that scares me. She always hated her father for leaving her, it messed her up so extremely much, even many years later she's so messed up. But maybe... maybe she's turned into that person.        
And again, maybe not. Maybe she hasn't changed, but she just did what she thought was best. But even if that's true, how can I trust her if she's willing to cut me off so easily? How can I open up to someone like that? How can I be myself?(an extremely open, honest person) I just don't know.        
And it hurts. If pain makes me a believer, I'm in a fucking cult by now. And to hear that I can't get better without her? I don't know if I can live like this...         
I went my entire life alone, never knowing what true happiness felt like... what love felt like. And when I finally did, it was taken from me.

I wish I could do more but I can't which in turn makes me even more depressed.

Even walking short distances is a chore for me, and it doesn't have do with deconditioning, because exercise doesn't make me stronger, but weaker.

It only lefts me weakened. So I stopped trying to do exercising, because it didn't improve my chronic fatigue at all or make me stronger, I also made no progress and got weaker actually.

324,I'm so tired of everything,3,128zh85,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/128zh85/im_so_tired_of_everything/,0,"24 (F)
I am the oldest grandchild of my family, and oldest sibling.
I've never had many friends through out school. I can't say I've ever went to a birthday party or anything besides people that I'm related to. Never hung out with anyone after school.


I have never had a job in my life.
I don't know how to drive.
My recent attempt at learning how to drive completely crushed my remaining spirits and has sent me into a downwards spiral as I am writing this.

Every day I wake up and do the same things over and over again with little variation.

I wake up and just think of how much of a disappointment I am. I was a fairly promising student in school that just completely fizzled out as I was diagnosed with depression early on in middle school. I watch as every single one of my younger family members accomplish their own things, start their first jobs, learn how to drive. Yet I have done absolutely nothing.

I have never felt “normal” my entire life. I am so awfully socially anxious, so scared to talk and meet others and try new things. I feel like I'm not actually using my body, instead I am a spirit just watching my near lifeless husk do its best.

I turn away anyone who goes out of their way to help me. I always say and pretend I would appreciate their help but never follow up on it.

I have ghosted nearly all of my “friends”, I ignored their texts and messages because I am so scared to reply. I do not even know what to reply. They have jobs, a car, and education meanwhile I have nothing to show for myself. I have been a NEET ever since graduating High School, and it has been slowly eating away at my life.

I dread family gatherings for the same reasons why I'm so scared to reply to my friends. Everyone knows I'm the weird one. Everyone knows I'm the failure, but they all ignore and pretend and the select few family members that offered to help? I keep on disappointing them each time. Every family gathering I fake a smile and try to go along with the flow as best I can hoping they don't talk about me. I have never liked being in the spotlight, but gossip is inevitable.

Sometimes I just dream of me becoming successful for once. Of me finally making  actual progress on my life. In those dreams there are happy tears in my eyes, I would even give a hopeful speech about my struggle and accomplsihments. But that is just a dream.

Every time I make a mistake I just get completely flustered and embarrassed, and it just keeps getting worse.

Every interaction with my parents is horrible. I can tell in their voice and gesture that they have given up on me, or at least think less of me. I knew from the day they became less strict on me and my future. I want to die so badly when that happens, I just huddle inside my room bawling my eyes out from negative thoughts. I was the oldest child and I had many things going for me only to end up as nothing. How can a parent be proud to have a child like me.

Living genuinely hurts, yet I know there are those who have it far worse. I am so sick of feeling like this yet it's like a neverending cycle. I don't know what to do but cry, cry and cry from these awful thoughts and feelings.",1680384538.0

All my other classes I’m passing with an A in it. I get I’m good in class but I’m disappointed in myself. I want to be better and have better grades than what I have now but I tried and yet I can’t get it. I want to be better but don’t see a future where I get it to 90.

Then I’m sad about my Lola getting Covid and Cancer but in the early stages of it. I jerk off and remember the fact my Lola is going to die and feel even more disappointed in myself. I get I’m young and should enjoy my youth but can’t. 

Friends of mine had manipulated me by showing a kind self but abusing another friend of mine and yet I can’t say anything because if I do she’s going to suspect the other friend said something to me. Another friend’s  moving and another was but isn’t my friend due to him not being able to keep a secret of mine and another friends. Another is possibly moving away due to personal issues.

326,Is it depression or just a temporary state I'm in?,2,1292x57,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1292x57/is_it_depression_or_just_a_temporary_state_im_in/,0,"hi, so I have a few things to confess, sorry if it doesn't make any sense. so, a few years ago I realized that I possibly have depression. I lose interest in many things when I start to like them, I'd feel lonely all the time (which is why it felt when I got a boyfriend it wasn't because of love and I guess it made me feel guilty and it wouldn't last more than 3 months).

I started eating a lot and I would have a hard time falling asleep at night etc. so my ex of 3 months (long distance) and we were in love and I was the happiest I'd ever be, but there was always this uneasy feeling inside where I'd feel like I should cry because I won't don't deserve it. like I wasn't good enough or that this won't last. therefore I broke up with him a few days ago, because it was a long distance and this uneasiness I felt. but within these few months, I promised I wouldn't do anything crazy so whenever I got angry or upset and had a tiny panic attack where it would be so hard to breathe, I'd call him and I would calm down, it was like he was the one to keep my demons away. it sounds stupid but who cares. This was just an example of things that happened.

(I would use this method of hitting my wrist with a hair tie and it would make it easier.)

it started to feel like I was using him to keep me sane, so I broke it off.

today I laid down on the carpet and just stared at that damn white ceiling and started crying because I felt again like I was a piece of shit. I just wanted to be loved and feel warm and okay, but I don't deserve it, I don't deserve any of what I had. like I don't know if I have any friends, no one checks up on me, my family can be a bit harsh with words but I can't go to them because they would feel so awful knowing the daughter they raised became like this, especially my mom.

I'm not going to end it, because I deserve to suffer as long as I live. seeking a therapist? not an option and talking to one of my ""friends"" would make it feel like I'm also using them, but what is there to talk about? I don't even know what's wrong with me. I cry because I eat too much, I cry when I feel lonely, I cry when I get mad, I cry when someone speaks harshly to me even if it's a little bit, and I cry and cry and cry.

to sum it all up, my confession is I'm tired, it sucks but you can't do anything and you have to keep going and that's what most of you feel. I would also like to say to you people who feel the same, I kept going and I hope this is enough to help you keep going today, tomorrow, and forever no matter how shitty it gets, you got it. also in case, nobody told you this today... I love you and I am so proud of you and everything you do. Now smile for the rest of your day and I hope it becomes so genuine that you do it every day.

these are for you and me;

1. you're not a burden to anyone.
2. you're beautiful/handsome inside and out.
3. don't starve yourself, eat, you're beautiful the way you are.

until tomorrow, friend <3",1680392281.0

I have never admired any girl as much as I do now, suppressing it was a bad decision, now I feel even more alone, I can't get over Helena, my mind is winning once again, admiring someone is stronger than carnal passion, and it's more painful when things don't turn out the way you'd like, when I think about it it's like a scratchy, endless scream of youth that constantly wants to be lived and that knows it's going to die, and I haven't learned to deal with it, time passes and I feel further away from anything, I'm not the same as before, that's not bad, but I don't want to say that it's good, and if it's indifferent why do I care so much? Sometimes I think that the internet may have messed with my head, and now I remember a printed shirt, and the print was like me and her, then I remember the hallways of college, what would I have done if I stayed there? Respect, emotional respect to sebr the time to say a yes or no. And it's true that I'll always have affection for her, the burning in my stomach continues and I want to throw up, I'm throwing up my thoughts now, who knows, maybe this will change something? At night, Belo Horizonte is still alive now that we are young people walking around in the early morning, each one wanting to get home and feel safe again.

Is it social phobia? But what if it's social phobia and I'm still right, what if it's a knack for figuring out what others think about me? Did that seem like a dumb thought? No? So was it smart? No?

I actually love living; I just hate MY life. I've always felt like I've been living the wrong life. When I say that, I mean things like who I am, who my parents are, and where I live. My life is not mine.

My (14m) family doesn't feel like my family. I don't have any real feelings for them, and  I'm just used to their presence. I've learned how to act genuine and fake my feelings iver time. I feel bad about this sometimes because we're taught to always love and respect our family, but these strangers I see on a daily bases are not my family. And before you say anything, I know that biologically, yes; we are related.

I also hate the way I'm living. I wish I could have control over my life and run far away to a different country. I daydream about running away and living a different life all the time. I know I'm lucky that my dad makes good money, but honestly, I'd rather be struggling and feel content with my life. Is that bad to say? 

Finally, wheneve I look in the mirror, I don't see me. The body I'm in is a stranger. I know I'm not supposed to look how I look, and I hate feeling this way. I want to rip my face off sometimes because I'm so sick of seeing a face that isn't mine.

I started therapy last year, and I broke down crying when he told me I suffered from a serious form of childhood neglect. I never really thought of it that way. My mom was an addict, my dad is cold and temperamental, he suffers from schizophrenia, they both tend to look out for themselves and I was told they're textbook narcissists. They tell you your parents are supposed to love you unconditionally, well, that's not true. Parental ""love"" is anything but unconditional, you're their child, they only act like they care because they think they have to.

I've had to deal with that my whole life, being abandoned over and over, moving houses over and over. I've moved more times in my life than I can count on two hands, I've never had stability, or safety.

This past year I thought I was doing better, I was diagnosed with OCD, GAD, clinical depression, bipolar, and to add to that I was diagnosed with autism when I was 12. I got put on meds, I was branching out in the world, I was putting myself together. I fell in love, even though I shouldn't have, with someone who made me feel safer than I have ever felt in my life. Someone I thought I could rely on, someone I felt was the first person in my life to ever see me as I was. I thought I finally saw a way out of everything, my therapist even told me this is what I've needed. Until they dumped me, cut me off, ghosted me like I never mattered, all because of something that wasn't my fault, then after six months of being lead on I was told that I had mistaken kindness for love. I suffered a lot of emotional trauma from this, and yet I still blame myself, I found anyway I could to blame it on myself and I made sure I was the problem in the end. 

I've dealt with a lot in my life, a lot of heartbreak, a lot of pain, a lot of questions about why I'm even here. I've always tried to keep my head up and tell myself that there is hope out there for something better, that this is just temporary, but after this I just don't think I have it in me to believe that anymore. I think I'm tired of waiting, and holding onto this belief that there's something good in the world because if there is, I seem to be a repellent for it. 

I try to do everything they say to, move on, to talk to people about it, or not talk to anyone at all and try to heal myself or whatever. I have spent every single day for the past three months feeling worse than I've ever felt in my life, I feel like every bad thought, every feeling, all my trust, my hope is just dead now. I'm trying hard not to feel that way but I'm so empty. 

I try talking to therapists, they just tell me to feel whatever I'm feeling but that it'll go away. I try to talk to family but they just tell me they're busy, or get annoyed with me, I try to talk to anyone it's always this lingering feeling of ""you did this to yourself"" ""you're the problem"" ""you're broken"" because that's all anyone ever sees me as. I'm incapable of being loved because I'm too much work to stick around for, I'm not worth it in anyone's eyes. You know how long I spend trying to prepare myself for the worst in every relationship I enter? This last one, I spent so long telling them ""I can be annoying, I'm sorry"" ""I do stupid things sometimes, please don't hold it against me"" ""I have anxiety, please be easy with me"" and they reassured me, I'm not going to leave you, I care about you so don't doubt it. What happened in the end? I was too annoying, I was too stupid, my faults weren't worth it.

How many times have I tried my best to be a good friend, to listen to others, only for them to betray me? I wait around for plans just for someone to forget, I get told I need a rain check, over and over, oh I just forgot about that day you were really looking forward to, oh I forgot that you wanted to talk about something for the past month. My own parents forget my birthday, my age, we don't celebrate holidays together. Teaching me how to drive is too much for them. My teachers would tell me I scared other kids because I didn't talk, that I need to speak up for myself, then when I speak up I'm too loud. I had to cut off my friends of eight years because it turned out they didn't like me as much as I thought they did, only for my next friend to stab me in the back, and for the next to only pretend to my friend because they were friends with someone I knew and they didn't want to be mean. People asking me out on dates as a joke, just to stand me up and leave me. People leading me on to believe they see me as attractive, telling me sweet nothings that a person like me is too vulnerable to deny but knows deep down they don't really care, and in the end they always show their true colors. You know what people used to say about me in school? I was the most likely to be a school shooter, because I was quiet, because I was afraid of other people, because every time I tried to talk to anyone they just laughed at me. I never try to hurt anyone, I'm so scared of hurting anyone and all I ever seem to do is hurt people for just being me. When I look at myself in the mirror I wanna punch myself in the face, because the only thing I see is a mistake, something that shouldn't exist. Don't try to tell me otherwise, because I've believed I had worth my whole life but it's clear to me now that the only worth I have in this world comes from myself, and if I'm not even worthy to him than what's the point of being here at all?

I don't even have the courage to do anything about it, all I can do is sit here and hope for hope, but even that's running out, I wake up everyday and I wonder why I have to.",1680389124.0

He’s just said he’s going to be very busy from now on and wont have much time to speak to me, and called me a friend in the process. 

I feel so heartbroken and upset, i have no idea how to get over this. Ive only ever had one other “crush”, who i ended up dating, and about a month after we broke up i felt better, because i could see all of his flaws, as well as the flaws in our relationship. 

Im really scared because i feel that everything with this guy was perfect. He was perfect, we worked well together, we worked perfect sexually, he is genuinely the smartest, kindest, funniest person ive ever met. 

I feel devastated right now and im so so scared that im never going to be able to get over him. Is there really such thing as ‘the one who got away’?

I can't absorb any information while watching movies or during conversations, or while reading.

Its extremely difficult to work in that environment which requires absolute focus. And sadly i can't do that anymore.

I just don't know what to do with myself most nights, I just kinda sit and listen to music, knowing that I want to do something different but not what I want to do.
I just feel like shit, and I've been really stressed out about school along with other personal things because I've been failing 2 of my subjects, one of which I need to get into college. and I'm really far behind on my coursework for another.

I started taking edibles a few months back and have grown more and more dependant on them. whenever I used to just sit and not know what to do, I now have the urge to get high and just forget about everything I have to do for a few hours. there's been multiple times in the past few weeks when I've purposefully taken way too much of an edible to give myself a panic attack at like 1 in the morning and I just lay down, shaking, trying get to sleep. and then I always feel like absolute shit the next day. I often have the urge to just ruin my life and fuck up everything I've done so far. it would feel so reliving to just drop everything, fail all my exams, not get a job, and take way too much and just die. that thought brings me the only peace I get... the thought that in the end once I die, nothing I do actually matters, and everything that I've been stressed about will be the least of anyone's problems.


I really hate calling myself depressed and sad and acting like a victim because of the whole 'victim mentality' shit which I don't want to fall into. I just kinda deal with anything that gets thrown at me. no matter how shit I feel, I won't tell anyone and just take it on the chin.
All my friends and family are convinced I'm really happy because I always act super positive around them. and I've almost convinced myself that what I'm dealing with isn't shit compared to other people because I have learnt to just deal with it and ignore it.

It feels like everything I've been ignoring is slowly building and it just ends up stressing me out even more but it make me feel better than just feeling sorry for myself and acting like such a victim of depression and stress when I can deal with it instead.

I've been feeling especially bad recently though which is what prompted me to write this, as much as I usually just deal with everything, I really just want to feel happy, for once. its gotten to the point where I can't concentrate because I'm always thinking about something that is causing me stress. everytime I'm doing something there's a thought that distracts me, everytime I'm not doing anything and just trying to relax, these thoughts come in 10x more and that's what worries me the most. because, I always stay up until at least 1am, sometimes later, which means I'm often left for hours just by myself, alone with my thoughts. I've grabbed a knife from the kitchen multiple times and thought about just cutting my wrists and dying, and how I would have no more worries ever. I also have really bad anxiety and OCD which really don't help at all.

It really feels like I'm just depressed as a baseline emotion and any happiness I feel is temporary and I know it'll always come back down again.

I moved from Florida to Nebraska 8 years ago because I was 18 and my parents split up and I had nowhere to go but got a good job in Nebraska. I immediately was going to move back because I didn't expect the cold to suck so much haha but met my now husband within the first 2 weeks. Ended up staying for.love and never got to move back to Florida even though I was so home sick and cried every winter. I never adjusted to winter and struggled constantly with missing Florida because I feel like I wasn't ever really ready to leave. I just knew I had to to be financially stable and was super upset over family splitting up. Over the years I became super close to husbands family and we all hung out every week multiple times a week and obviously built a life. But still never figured out how to survive winter and seasonal depression was destroying me. We finally moved back to Florida 5 months ago even though I was the ONLY one who wanted to move. We have a 4 year old and 3 year old and just last week gave birth to twins. Away from any and all family. My husband was tired of.seeing me sad so moved us here but now all I feel is intense guilt and sadness knowing I ruined everyone's lives. My daughter left her school that she LOVEEEDDDD her teacher and still constantly like daily asks about her and tells me she wishes we didn't leave Nebraska. She also constantly asks about her cousins and uncles and cries about missing them and all her friends there. I thought she'd adjust but she hasn't and is struggling daily. I am always so sad and riddled with such guilt it ruins my days and makes me feel so sick with regret which sucks because I'm the whole reason we are here. I am thinking if she doesn't adjust in 2 years I'm going to just move back so I feel better. Does anyone have experience? Like seriously maybe I should have tried harder to adjust to winter. But winter last so freaking long and I grew up always being able to be outside and at the beach.,1680395599.0

361,I am the Child of Regretful Parents,3,128u80c,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/128u80c/i_am_the_child_of_regretful_parents/,0,"I'm posting this on here because r/regretfulparents doesn't allow posts from children of regretful parents and I didn't know where else to post this so here it goes. I would also like to add a trigger warning, there are mentions of suicidal ideation, mental health struggles and self harm. I also didn't proofread this so please excuse any mistakes. I just need to express how I'm feeling right now. 

My parents met when they were really young and got married by the time my mom was 21. She felt that she was ready to have a child then but it took her almost 10 years to fall pregnant with me. She told me that she had always dreamt of having four children but I made her change her mind because I was a difficult baby and a difficult toddler. My father couldn't handle that my infant self was getting more of my mom's attention so he decided to look for attention elsewhere. My father had always been an alcoholic but because verbally abusive to my mother because he was angry from the lack of attention. I'm not sure if it was physical too but I'm too afraid to ask and I don't want to trigger her. 

They got divorced when I was 4/5 years old and I know for a fact that I'm the reason why. And this is when my mother emotionally signed out of being my mom. I wasn't the baby doll she wished for. She couldn't dress me up control my every movement so I was left to be my own parent. 

I remember performing in school concerts, receiving awards and public speaking without anyone in the crowd ready to congratulate me when I got off stage. I remember starting to feel a hole in my heart and feeling it getting deeper with every passing day. Since the divorce, I've only seen my father 9 times and they were all bitter moments. The last time I looked into his eyes I saw a stranger. I mourn my idea of what I wish my father was. I mourn a man that lives. 

When I was around 8/9 I remember having suicidal thoughts and I told my mom and that I was scared but all she did was tell me to stop talking about such nonsense and that I shouldn't even think about it because I would burn in hell forever when I died. 

The fear of burning for eternity scared me and I guess I repressed the feeling until I couldn't anymore. When I was 14 I just stopped feeling anything. I talked to my friends about it and they said that maybe it would go away and I would feel fine. I didn't. We had a subject in school called Life Orientation and one of the chapters was about mental illness and warned us of signs to look out for in depressed people and it felt like a checklist of what I was experiencing. 

The only thing not on the list was self harm so I decided to give it a try. So one day I took a scissor and dragged it across my left wrist and made 5 cuts. They hurt so bad but after a while there was a sense of relief, calm and happiness. A few days passed and there were scars and they wouldn't go away. I was scared of what would happen if anyone noticed but no one ever did. 

I had tried numerous times to tell my mom that I was feeling things that scared me and that I was afraid I was depressed and that I thought it would help if I saw a therapist. She told me I was overreacting and that I didn't know what I was talking about and that I only though I was depressed because being mentally ill was a new ""trend"" and told me to get over it. I couldn't though. 

One day when I was 17 I had a lot of panic attacks and my lungs had become inflamed. I couldn't pull myself out of bed without feeling excruciating pain in my chest. I cried out for help and my mom rushed me to the emergency room and the doctor ran a bunch of tests and told her I had anxiety and should start seeking professional help. But she didn't think it was that serious and thought I was overreacting and once again told me to get over it. 

A friend and I had a discussion about his therapist and the things they talked about and I decided to book an appointment with him. My mother and I would fight after every therapy session and undo all the progress I have made over our 5 sessions. So I decided to stop going. Talking to my therapist had made me realise how alone I had been in my thoughts and emotions and made me realise that my mom didn't have my best interest at heart. 

I tried my best to work through what my psychiatrist calls ""severe symptoms of depression"" to build myself a better life and managed to get myself into one of the more advanced private universities in my country. She was proud for a little while. 

I mercilessly worked myself through my school work until I couldn't anymore and I broke down. I was institutionalised for 3 weeks and they were the best days of my life. I had doctors who would check on me daily and I learnt more about my depression and anxiety and also got an OCD diagnosis which helped explain a lot of my obsessions around things that don't matter.

My mother and sister came to visit when I was institutionalised but I wish my mother hadn't. All she did was remind me that she was wasting her time visiting me when she could be working instead. 

I've been doing a lot better since then. The meds they put me on helped stabilise my hormonal imbalance and I don't feel as down as I used to. I even have moments when I feel happy. 

My relationship with my mother hasn't changed though. She thinks I'm weak for being on medication for my mental health disorders. She also reminds me every moment she gets that I'll never make it in the real world on my own.

She always complains about how hard it is to be a single mother of two and how it's hard to take care of us but won't let me get a part time job. She throws a tantrum whenever I ask her to take me anywhere for things I need for school but won't help me with the process of getting my driver's licence. I basically have no autonomy and I can't help but think that it's all purposeful.

I'm really trying my best to keep living and having new experiences but I'm just so fucking exhausted. We just had another fight and I'm writing this because I think I need to accept that I am a burden in her life. I try to make myself as small and quiet as I can to avoid getting called weak, selfish and lazy when I do anything wrong. I'm also writing this because I've been four months clean from self harm and I don't want to slip back into old habits. I don't know how much longer I can handle living with her. I hope that when I'm done with university and start earning money I'll be able to move out and stop being her problem. 

I also want to add that us children of regretful parents can tell that our parents didn't want us. I hate being alive just as much as my parents do. I'm begging you from the deepest part of my soul not to have kids if you know you won't be able to show them unconditional love. My mom makes sure that there's a roof over my head and that I'm fed but that's all I get. Asking for a parent I can go to when I'm feeling down or when I need support is honestly pushing it too far. I spend so much time looking for love and validation from people who only want to satisfy their lust and I can't stop no matter how hard I try to stay away.",1680373153.0

Last summer I caught my husband buying porn and using porn again for the last time. Throughout our 6 years together (3 years married)  he has always cheated with multiple women (including my sister) watched porn and visited backpages. (an escort site for those who don't know) He was also physically and verbally abusive, sometimes. Last may his father died who was his best friend and a couple months later I left my husband due to his constant unfaithfulness. Fast forward to october I move out, take the car which is in my name and get my own apartment. It's now march and alot has happened since then. Ive grown cold to him and have no desire in my heart to help him or be nice to him, even though I still help him and am nice to him. I've been struggling financially for awhile and ask family for help often. I had a good job coming up but due to unseen circumstances it was delayed and my car was repo'd. So now, it hurt my credit and the ex husbands credit. He was livid, told his whole family what happened and I guess has been telling his family how terrible Ive been to him and how much I have ""hurt"" him. So now his family, who I used to be close with, now hates me & my family is tired of me calling crying looking for a shoulder & me calling asking for help until I get this better job. A close friend of mine randomly also switched up on me, probably because shes also tired of hearing about my constant downward spiral of a life. Now I am left, with no one who cares to hear me or be there for me, even though I have been there for everyone countless times.

I’ve tried hotlines but the people are so scripted. Went to my psych and for some reason I was happy that day, didn’t tell him what was going on. Avoided telling him about the delusions or substance use because I’m afraid of being put on antipsychotics when it’s not a constant thing. 
Today saw my therapist and did tell him  about the dark thoughts and he joked around that I was too smart for my own good. He was 20 mins late for our session and silent most of the time. The rest of the time joking. He said my boyfriend makes other people’s lives hard with his drinking as a way to somehow convince me that me making other people’s lives hard with my mental illness wasn’t an issue?
I told my bf my issues and he told me to go to the pros. No one cares. I got angry and my sisters took notice of that and took away my car keys overnight but just gave them back next day. It’s like I’m trying to communicate with people who could help me and none of them believe me or are willing to help. Which just makes it so much worse. I don’t think people care.

Its kinda long too. Im posting this to a few forums cuz i need to vent and my mental health is suffering. Forgive me if this isnt allowed here just remove it. I just need to feel someone cares or listens even if you dont.
Im 39 m london. My whole life ive wanted a muscular girlfriend. In fact ive never had a relationship . Ive only ever been attracted to muscular women but never met any in person. Zero. I cant help it, normal women just dont do it for me. I hate it and hate feeling shallow but i cant help it. I dont think id be happy with someone regular. Obviously i know muscle doesnt last forever so personality matters , i just would have liked to meet a woman whos muscular and experience it . Its not all that matters especially long term but i cant give up on that.
Another problem is my whole life ive suffered crippling depression. I also stopped caring about life and got really fat. So naturally i feel its unfair to want a muscular gf when ic ant get fit myself. Yet i also find it hard to beat my depression feeling alone. I always hoped id find someone who could help me get fit and develop a relationship with but it never happened.
Ive been in so ,many fights online over the years verbally because i tried reaching out to fit women and always got ignored. That always triggered me because ive always felt invisible. I also have a mental,learning disability so im not exactly what youd call a catch. Im torn between knowing most muscular women wouldnt want me and hoping for someone who will. But it lead to so many arguments i regret. Ive been resentful for a long time of dudes who get muscular women. Really bitter. Its made me angry. I said a lot of vile shit to people and hurt people i regret because i felt rejected and ignored. I have tried my best to beat this with therapy but i still do it occasionally and i hate it. It makes me feel like im back at square one when i fight online with someone . I know its illogical and i know no one owes me a response,i know im in the wrong to insult. But the pain and being alone blots out my logic until later when im remorseful as hell.
I decided two years ago to try. To not give up on life which is where i was for most of my life. But its so so hard. I want to be decent and worthy of these women. But i also know even if i get fit i dont even know any muscular women so it makes it feel even more pointless when im feeling down. Because i do want to be fit but im not a fan of exercise and really am trying to get fit not just for health but because i find it unfair i want a fit woman when im not fit myself. But its so so hard to stay positive.
I am trying to be a decent less bitter angry person. It hurts to see guys who are living a life with a woman who seems great with every quality i love. I know im not entitled to love and try to remember that. I try to remember when ive been mean and rude and how i dont wanna be that way.
One woman specifically i truly began to care for and it ended in a bad argument, she later forgave me but stopped talking. Id do anything for that friendship back but i caused its loss and thats on me
Ive made some progress. Since jan ive gone from 131kg to 124 just under. But i dont feel much better and feel so far to go. And in addition i found i had a pituitary brain tumour so i need surgery at some point as well as find ing out its what cause me low test all my life. I feel so much is against me. I even feel sometimes if i die during surgery id feel better
I know this has been kinda a self pity rant i just needed to tell someone because i dont have anyone to talk to. Idk if anyone cares i just feel rock bottom. Im not giving up yet , i will keep trying to be better. Its just so hard and right now ive never felt more alone",1680392574.0

My parents aren't emotionally there for me (I have avoidant attachment as a result, which hurts me & other people), that depresses me.

If I didn't leave college I would've kept a great friend group. If I just stuck with one major I would've been done by now, & I should've just gone with my initial decision. If I didn't break up with my first bf I probably would be really happy & kept all the friends I made through him. But all of this is in the past & I can't change it. I've tried making friends, truly I have, but I fail every time. I can't change my health issues. The one thing I'm trying to actively ""change"" is taking more classes in the following semesters to finish earlier, & I can only hope that that at least distracts me from my sadness. Then I will try to find a remote job & possibly go back to school to become a therapist. Though all of that feels very out of reach & I get all these negative thoughts about being behind, failing, etc.

My depression isn't a chemical imbalance. I can pinpoint every reason that I'm depressed, but I still can't do anything about it.",1680361913.0

Then that overwhelming sense of loneliness and emptiness joins in, too. And then that sudden momentary call of energy and optimism. This sudden need to be desired, sexually and emotionally. At that moment you would do anything just to get someone's attention, and preferably seize it for more than a fleeting glance. This desire makes you forget about self-respect, your morals and comfort. You look for and can't find a momentary consolation, a nice toy that will make you feel like a normal person and not a disgusting monster. You push shame and embarrassment aside as dignity leaves you with every tear that glides down your face. Desperation begins to control your life, but you lack the courage.

I haven't seen my twin cousins for over a decade and finally yesterday I had the chance to meet them at their 18th birthday party. Just seeing them all grown up made me realize how badly I screwed up my 20s.

I will be 30 in less than 2 months and I have nothing to show for my life. I am unemployed, fat as fuck, kissless virgin who has no hobbies or interests and no friends. 

From my early to mid 20s, I used to watch all the motivational videos there was to watch and read all the self improvement stories on reddit so I tried to better myself but I always failed,  scared to face the world and just a bit of taste of hardships made me give up, so I went back to my boring, unproductive and unsocialized life which was a safe haven. 

Last year I finally had enough of it and thought I should tackle one problem at a time. I was tired of working a minimum wage job and wanted a better career. I heard programming job paid good and since I had no idea what I liked, I gave this one a try. I was very serious to learn programming so much so that I quit my full time job (horrible decision) and go full time self studying. The first week or two I was very excited to learn and daydreamed how I would finally get a good career that pays nice, but as days went by and the course got more difficult, procrastination creeped in and I went to my old habit of watching porn instead (another failure). It has been 3 months since I quit my full time job and burning through my savings, I am now going back to my old job next week. 

I hate this! I don't know what to do. I have tried and tried to better myself but I always fail. I am a failure. I am tired and beaten. Sometimes I don't even look both ways when crossing the road.

Things were going so well. Now you're wallowing in self pity, depression, feelings of disgust and uselessness. Let's not forget calling yourself faggot over and over. Why do you do that? You get this sick feeling of pleasure when you depreciate yourself, and it's becoming addicting again. 

Remember your early 20s? Remember how you wasted away years in bed crying and feeling sorry for yourself? Remember how you used to hurt yourself over and over? Remember how you broke your hand by punching trees until your knuckles bled? Remember how you used to punch yourself on the nose until you bled and just sat there letting yourself lose as much blood as you could stand? 

I do remember. I remember becoming so thoroughly addicted to feeling sorry for myself that I spiral out of control. Now you're crying again, you stupid useless faggot. You couldn't even keep (ex BF). He's fleeing and it's your fault. You should honestly think about ways to kill yourself. Your brain is so thoroughly fucked that you can't even have sex normally. What kind of man doesn't get hard at the thought of fucking someone? You. You're the kind of useless faggot that only gets hard thinking about being abused and getting fucked. Deep down I know what I am. I need to be treated as the stupid, useless cumdump that I know I am. You're never going to be in a normal relationship, so just give up being happy. 

(ex BF) left you, probably because you're even professionally worthless. You can't even make enough money to support him. You don't have the balls to ask for a raise again. He's leaving you because yet again, you're not worth it. You're super not worth it. 

This is why you can't have a gun, you would probably blow your brains out. Thinking about sweet nothingness is blissful. Imagine being able to be so extremely disappointed in yourself that you cry yourself to sleep every night. Imagine not feeling those intense waves of pleasurable depression. Imagine not feeling anxious about your job, your non-existent sex life, your relationship. Imagine not imagining.

He gave me hope in the possibility of having a life partner. But now you're home. You know the truth. You'll never be happy, your real family, where you feel most at home, will be with you until you die. 

So why not give up? Why not end it? What purpose do I serve if I'm just going to wallow in self pity the rest of my life? Honestly, remember, you're less than dogshit. You're less than the worst person you know. Have fun, and welcome home you useless sack of shit.",1680333395.0

Hi. If one person would read my post and give some insight that would help a lot.

So yesterday I had an episode. I work from 2pm-10pm. I get home around 10:15ish. Takes me an hour to fall asleep and then I wake up usually around 8/9. I tried waking up at 7, I set an alarm but it is so hard for my body. Yesterday was my first day back at work after my 2 days off. I feel like I honestly waste my days off and it gets to me a little. I feel like I should be enjoying life but all I do is go home, maybe I will go to the gym, go grocery shopping and that's it. I get stoned via edibles but honestly I do that so I can feel some physical feeling in my life. (I GO TO THE GYM SO DONT REC THAT) The concept of wasting time is getting to me. Whenever I am stoned I have ideas of what I want to play/watch but in reality I end up doing nothing. Sometimes what I am watching bores me and I can't finish or I can't decide what I want to do and end up doing nothing.

So yesterday around 9/10AM i decided to go to the gym. But my room is a mess.. I have been prolonging cleaning my room.. The more I prolong it the more I am starting to dread it. But when I was getting ready in my room I couldn't find one shoe... whenever I can't find something I start pancaking. I couldn't find the shoe so I started freaking out. I start to get frustrated and my feelings were overwhelming me.

I start to shake and breath heavily. I honestly feel like I am overreacting when this happens. I just had the feeling that I needed to leave and go to the gym. Go somewhere as soon as possible but not here. Because I couldn't find my shoe I was freaking out. I ended up finding a pair I haven't worn in years and attempted to put it on. I couldn't tie the laces right, they were super short and I was getting flustered. I threw a little bit of stuff in my room but I ended up getting the shoes on. My parents were home when all of this was going on.

My parents are working on a puzzle and where we hang up our car keys is above the puzzle. I started shaking and attempted to grab my keys in a hurry. It ended up dropping on the puzzle and some of it got on the floor. My mother was devastated and started to get very sad (understandably she is going through things rn and the puzzle is her world) seeing her reaction started to make me feel depressed. I didn't want to go to the gym anymore and started to breakdown.

And then he reveals he started to not see me as long-term material and that we could use what we had between each other to grow as people and then go our separate ways. 

And I just keep asking myself why I wasn't good enough once he saw the real me to keep trying for our relationship.

Once I rightfully got mad at him I asked if we should break up and he said yes.

I got a closure talk and he couldn't even tell me what didn't make me good enough. But his silence when I said I wasn't good enough for him told me everything I needed to realize that I was right. I wasn't.

Nothing about me is good enough. And this confirmed it. I haven't been able to stop thinking about him and wondering what I did wrong or daydreaming about what kind of different person I could be to have been better.

But I'm stuck like this.

This all reads like a bad novel but no one can feel the pain I feel in my chest all the time or the hot headaches I get because of how much I hate myself. Sometimes I'm scared I'm suppressing self harming thoughts.

Cocaine addiction has caused me to have Raynauds and now I can no longer live a normal life. I will never find another woman, and I'll certainly never find a meaning in this life.

Work is stressful. Home is stressful. *Existing* is stressful. There hasn't been a moment this entire *year* where I wasn't stressed. If I'm awake and not in bed, I'm stressed out and anxious. Sometimes I'm stressed and anxious even just lying in bed.  

I have no goals, dreams, aspirations, desires. No fun hobbies or exciting plans. Nothing to look forward to. Video games are no longer fun or interesting, TV shows and movies are all the fucking same, and I can't read a book for more than 5 minutes without my mind wandering back to my miserable existence.  

Drugs don't help (prescription or recreation). Therapist after therapist has tried to help me by changing my mindset, deconstructing my negative self-talk, creating positive habits like dieting and exercising - none of it ever fucking sticks or helps in the slightest.  

I'm 31 years old. I've felt this way since I was 9. I've given it everything I have. I've tried every fucking possible avenue of self-improvement I've ever heard of or been advised about. Nothing has worked.  

My only ""goal"" has been to enter into a relationship. But you need to be a functional human being in order to have a partner. Partnerships/relationships are about sharing your life with someone, after all - and how do you do that if you don't have one to begin with? No one deserves to be stuck in a relationship with someone like me. So my only real desire in life is impossible...why fucking bother?  

Feels weird that it's finally come to this even though I always knew it would. But I just can't keep pretending like my life is even somewhat OK.

I feel empty, and I don’t even know why. I’ve felt on and off like this for years (my therapist says I probably have persistent depressive disorder) — as if nothing matters at all, what’s the point of any of it, why do I even try? 

The thing is I’m beyond high functioning… I kind of have it all at least from the outside. I’m relatively wealthy (self made, and if I stopped working I wouldn’t have to worry about money for 20-30 years at minimum). My parents love me and support me. I’ve got great friends whom I can call whenever and they’ll be there to listen to me (about my depression for the 20th time), and make new friends easily. I’m still young (late 20s), relatively fit, have some hobbies, and while I don’t have a relationship right now (honestly stuck in a situationship I don’t love) I shouldn’t have anything in life to complain about.

I’ve read the books, listened to the podcasts, been going to therapy and really working on myself both emotionally and just reflecting. Also no substance abuse of any type (I do indulge in the occasional drink with friends).

Reading this sub, I sometimes even question if my feelings are valid (against the advice of my therapist).

Despite all this every day I just feel so empty. I constantly ask myself why any of this matters. What was the point of pushing myself to achieve all these things.

I’m really struggling right now. I’m always very self conscious and I hate my appearance and myself. I hate everything about my body from my face to my intimate area. I’ve always been fat and now currently weighing 240 lbs, I feel more disgusting as ever. I try and motivate myself to get up in the morning and go for a run but that morning never comes as I find peace in sleep. Sleep is the only time that I don’t feel like shit. I dodge mirrors as much as I can to avoid looking at myself because it makes me feel physically sick. I shower in the dark so I don’t have to see myself naked. I’m usually in bed for around 8:30pm every night sometimes watch YouTube on my phone or even just lay and stare at the ceiling until I fall asleep.   


I really wish I could find a girl to love. I’m 22 this year and never had a girlfriend and seeing all my friends or even strangers on the street loved up makes me happy for them for but I feel worse in myself knowing that I probably won’t even find that girl who I can make happy as well her making me happy. I think my weight is holding me back and it looks like my hair has started to recede. I love my hair and it has put me in such a state of sadness and anxiety that only thing I do like about myself is slowly going. This also affects my confidence because I feel I’m against the clock to find a girl before I ultimately go bald because what 22 year old girl wants a bald boyfriend?   


My height is another thing. I’m 5’9 and it makes me feel really self conscious when I walk past people on the street or even some of my friends and they’re taller than me. We all know girls like guys over 6ft so I’m instantly put down the pecking order.

I understand if anyone sees this post as a ‘woe is me’ essay but this how I’m feeling right now and I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. If anyone does read this, thank you. Thank you for taking the time to read this when you didn’t have to because like I said at the start I’m nobody to you.

I've taken 8 antidepressants, a mood stabiliser, an antipsychotic, a stimulant, and benzos, and the only one that's helped is the benzos as my depression is caused by my anxiety.

456,I hate this world,34,127tjdb,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/127tjdb/i_hate_this_world/,6,"This is my first post and it'll probably be all over the place so bear w me.

When I was 9 my dad and his fiance killed themselves, he shot himself, and she overdosed. My mom and dad were divorced my whole life and I have like 4 families due to step parents. After my dad died they tried to get me to do therapy but I couldn't really fully understand what had happened and didn't really greif bc I wasn't really depressed or overly sad then. He died and it was kind of an ""ok"" reaction. It really didn't affect me much then, but as I have grown up it has affected me a lot more. I am 2 weeks away from the 8 year mark of my dad killing himself and I want to die so badly.

I tried therapy when I was younger but stopped bc I didn't really need it, but a few years ago depression had come up in conversation w my mom and I said I kind of wanted to try therapy again but I think she kind of ignored it bc I had been so adamant on not wanting it before. I still haven't talked to her about it, but I've talked to my older sister and she has encouraged me to talk to her about it and to get into therapy but I'm kinda just scared. 

I kind of don't want anyone involved in my relationship with my dad because he was not the best person but he was never bad to me. I have been told that my sister was sexually abused by my father, and she also recently told me that he used to blackmail her by threatening me. And I don't care, I dont care what anyone says about my dad, because I had to stand up to my mom when I was like 12 to tell her to stop talking shit about my dead father in front of me. I have had so many people talk badly about my dad after he died and I've had people lie to me about my dad so I would view him differently and I had to make a choice to only view my dad based off of my own memories bc I don't want to wind up hating him for the rest of my life bc someone lied to me about something. 

I feel so conflicted about everything in my life, I hate myself, I'm overweight and I've lost 40 pounds in the last 7 months but I've been stuck and I feel so unaccomplished with everything in my life. I'm in a pit of depression and I'm pushing everyone away. I really only have one friend and I'm really close w him, but I've been pushing him away the last couple of week bc I'm hurting so much and just want to be left alone bc I have no compassion rn, he's going through shit that I could not care less about, bc I'm going through the same shit but also so much more so I don't wanna hear it. I wish no one knew or cared about me, I wouldn't have to be compassionate, I would be able to be alone and that's all I want rn. 

I dont want to/can't kill myself, but I want to die, I dont want to be here, this whole world fucking sucks and there's nothing good bound to come with staying here, but I'll do it anyway. I'm killing myself of all emotions i think, I feel like if my best friend killed himself infront of me rn I would just keep going on, not in a strong way, in a way I would wish I was dead every second of everyday, but I just dont want to feel anymore.

I need help. I’m lost. I’m hurt, angry,confused. I lost my mom last year and I’ve always struggled with addiction but I’m pretty much sober now(only smoking cannabis)

Ok no more context: I got into a a huge argument with my aunt who I currently live with because of the death of my mom. I’ve been smoking my wax pen in my room yk? I thought I was being careful. Smoking out the window, closing my vents and covering my door at the bottom. My aunt smelled this and basically was hella pissed. Idk this is where the argument started. But for the sake of time I’m not going to go into details that are somewhat irrelevant. Ok her and her husband start yelling and going off and doing all the xtras. I get so pissed I’m not even arguing back at them. I get so pissed I feel this intense feeling take over my entire lower body and arms. My hand s were shaking so much they hurt. So I punched the wall. It left a mark but not a crack.

anyways I proceede it storm out. Not even because I’m mad at them. I’m just surprised and in disbelief that happened. I’ve never been so angry before. I’m usually pretty chill and being angry is not a usual emotion . Hitting the wall was something I wasn’t even thinking about doing. All of the sudden I hit the wall idfk how it happened.

so I leave the house, and in such idk being surprised being upset idk. I couldn’t r bring myself to go back home. So I spent the night at a friends. And came back around 10am. When I came home my aunt answered the door and says nothing. She just moves to the side and let’s me in the house.Ok again for the sake of time I’ll skip some of the other things.

this is when things got extra heated

I go downstairs to try and talk to my aunt and apologize. I try to explain to her how I know I got too upset and I wouldn’t bring anything into the house again. She didn’t give me the chance. She started going on and on and ON about how she’s being disrespected in her house. Then she starts putting her finger in my face so all I do was move her hand out of my face. I didn’t hit her. I never actually forcefully or intended any harm. After that she started screaming saying I hit her. And I was like what the fuck?? So I get even more upset and before I even have a chance to get too upset like how I did previously. I leave.

maybe leaving isn’t the best way to have dealt with it. But how things turned out before I didn’t want anyone to see that side of me again.

I go to work, come back home and go to my room. I’ve been in my room only leaving for water because my room has a bathroom attached. I’ve just been here because I don’t know how I’m supposed to handle this situation. I’m posting this long ass story because I need help.

Firstly, around 8 months ago my wife demanded a divorce and took our 2 kids and left back to her home country of Norway. I simped and agreed to it, in hope that she wouldn't do it and let the kids see their dad regularly but she did it anyway. She's a child of divorce so she thought it would be fine for them and me because her dad left her and her mum and she supposedly was fine with it.

Secondly, throughout the past 3 months of being alone, i have been having blackouts while driving at my job (truck driver). Ive also had wierd feelings in my chest, and pains in my arms and shoulders. These happen when i get nervous and i dont know what the triggers are.

Thirdly, i tried to get help for this with the doctor and ive been told to not drive until the root cause has been found and treated. if it is found that i have symptoms of syncope and an irregular heart beat causing not enough blood going to my brain, i will be banned from driving for at least 12 months.

So within less than 1 year i have lost my house, my friends, my wife, my kids, my job, my regular weekly earnings from my job, my licence, my health, and although i had lost my mind since 2014 - it's now so bad i doubt it will ever recover.

Please tell me why any sane person would carry on living like this? I despise it when people say to get up and go to the gym...

Feels like I’m doomed or destined to fail even tho I remind myself that that’s untrue and I can try to make my life fulfilling but I guess after 8 years of trying to manage my ADHD, MDD and anxiety and still feeling very much turbulent, I find it so hard to keep holding on. 

The only thing that’s keeping me going rn is the idea of leaving my dysfunctional home environment and possibly having my own space where I at least feel comfortable and safe enough to just be unapologetically and authentically, me. 

I’m always on survival mode even when I’m at home. It’s hard to even go to the kitchen without feeling out of place. I’m always scared I’m too loud yadayadayada it’s depressing and hard to explain without getting into all the details why my living situation sucks. 


I’ve been trying to move out of my “home” but at best I still have 4+ months till I can even start looking for a room to rent. I’ve been counting down the days but it’s just been agonizing all the same. I tell myself I can do this, just 100 more days in this small room but escape feels so far away. 

I know my health won’t magically change after I leave but being here, I’m constantly living in fear.

Every time I feel like a failure he’s there to confirm that I indeed am one. Everything I do is wrong in his eyes, and honestly in mine now too. When I was younger he got upset with me & told me I was useless, it has stuck with me since. But everything he tells me is true which is probably why it makes me even more upset. Every time I see him, I lash out on him & I regret it right after. Every negative thought I have about myself, he’s there to confirm that my thoughts are true. Every time I come to visit we argue more than we bond, yet I still miss him like crazy when I go back home. He’s so nice to everyone but me, he justifies everyone behavior yet I’m always in the wrong. Ironically enough a lot of what he does is now wrong in my eyes too. I hold resentment for him cheating on my mom (though he says he wasn’t), I personally think creating emotional relationships with other women is cheating especially when you don’t have that with your own family. My dad was so depressed & was at his lowest, while we were there for him he asked to talk to his “friend”. That hurt, & seeing my mom hurt was one of the saddest feelings. Today I was complaining about my roommates bf being there 4-7 days out the week & how I’m unable to sleep bc they’re so noisy & he said “you just make yourself hard, he has a right to be there bc she pays rent for that room” honestly it wasn’t all that bad but I just wanted to start sobbing. Maybe I’m overreacting. He makes me feel like such a bitter person, & you know what part of me feels that way to bc everything angers me. I can go on & on as I just need to vent. Though I love my dad, I don’t feel connected to him & it saddens me. It’s breaks my heart. When I’m not around my father I miss, but when I’m in his presence I’m sometimes uncomfortable/annoyed. I do try & empathize with him as he has his own trauma/mental health but man. I feel guilty for feeling this way towards him bc despite all of this he is a good dad & helps me in whatever way he can.

lately, i haven’t been eating at all. she’s the only one who can make me really eat anymore. from my looks, you wouldn’t guess that i skip meals every single day. she calls me pretty. she says i’m her favorite person. she shows me with her actions that she really cares. though we never hug, which i wish we did more. 

she comforts me when i have panic attacks, although i rarely tell her about them unless it’s bad enough for me to hurt myself. she drops everything and comes over. i don’t know what id do without her. i don’t want to be in a time when i’m not with her around. 

today, while walking around the mall, i felt as if our time was running out. we’ve been friends for over 8 years but i still somehow think that one day, she will leave me, and i will be completely alone.

You'll never be able to relive the times that made you feel alive. Like really alive. So alive that you disconnect from reality, everything is nothing and nothing begins to makes sense. Being so fucked up that you have to contemplate reality and wheather or not you're actually real or not.

Nothing matters. Just getting so fucked up that you can't feel anything. Living in the moment. Escaping from your troubles at home and just forgetting what problems even are. Life is good. Home life erased, don't have to worry about hiding or keeping quiet. The only thing that matters is staying in that moment. Staying in a constant state of limbo. Euphoria. Pure bliss. Nothing else matters. Freedom. Freedom to think, to feel, freedom to BE.

I long for the days where I didn't have to feel or think or exist. Just let myself go, let my consciousness do all of the work. Disappear.

Two days ago, I was crossing the road and thinking of an incoming car, that I wish it would hit me. Then, I got a notification on my phone. Someone sent me some aid with a message of 'You can do it.' and I burst into tears when I read it. Because I need to hear that the most.

Yes, I can do it. I can do it. Slowly, slowly, like every hurdles in life, I can get through them.

I sit for a while thinking of all the faces I love, who love me, cheered for me, rooting for me, a friend said he is waiting for me to get my first job IT, and I have promised my guardian angel that I will come and meet him again once I scored my goals. I know my family, friends wanted to see me succeed. They want to see me happy, able to take care of myself.

Then I think but who cares about how it sucked for me and how it affected me. Then I’m stuck again wanting to talk about things and not at once. I suppose it’s my cross to carry.

Right now, I'm thinking of waiting for the 6-month mark with my ketamine, and then trying ECT. After trying all of that, I want to see if I can get brain surgery (anterior cingulotomy) and see how things go from there. 

My plan is that I either get better after all of that, or it's still unchanged and Switzerland will see my medical history and euthanize me lmao",1680322959.0
533,my depression is hurting everyone around me,6,127ungk,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/127ungk/my_depression_is_hurting_everyone_around_me/,4,"They know nothing they do will make me truly happy. It hurts so bad when I see my parents are trying and all I can do is give them a fake smile. It hurts when my friends want to surprise me with something and they can tell I don’t care. I really want to care. I want to care about them, I want all of them to know that they matter to me. It’s just that I think I’m incapable of being any cheerful. At best if I’m busy enough I sometimes manage to think of something different than the gloom. But that is hardly any better, just a few moments where life is merely bearable. 

I want to end it finally but I can’t because it’s more bother than I can take. I don’t want to hurt those close to me, my parents especially. They’d be devastated. They will never even think of that but I know they would be better off without me. It would sure hurt for a while but after some time they’d realise all I was was a burden. Because how could you love/like someone who is nothing but their illness? All I bring into their lives is negativity and problems and none of them deserve that.

This was encouraged even more so by family when my suicidal thoughts first started a long time ago. Long story short, I did exactly that for a long time. It never worked because nobody knew how to help. But I still tried to reach out because there was still a (very stupid) part of me that thought maybe this time they’ll actually have an idea on how to help me feel better. Fast forward to today and I now have a completely different problem on top of the old one. Whenever I ask for help or reach out to someone because I just need to talk, nobody believes most of what I say. When people hear how often and how badly I feel sadness throughout my life, they keep telling me some variation of “Just choose not to feel that way”. Obviously they don’t say that word for word but it’s very easy to reword. A few examples I’ve heard are “Maybe don’t CHOOSE to focus on those negative thoughts”, “You should CHOOSE to look at more positive things in life” “You would probably feel better if you didn’t CHOOSE to hold onto that negativity”. I’m not complaining about the friends/family members who have said these things. I mean, the fact that they even took the time to talk to me shows that their words are coming from a good place. But regardless, I just wish that the concept of someone’s own emotions being out of their grasp wasn’t so hard to understand for most people. It makes me afraid to even ask for help when I’m feeling depressed or suicidal because I’m afraid of hearing that again. I know it shouldn’t get to me that badly but at this point it feels like people are saying that I’ve chosen my depression and it hurts because I seem to be the only person in the world who believes that I’m actually trying my best.",1680306780.0
541,My dad (44) has stage 4 cancer and I’m a wreck,2,128488k,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/128488k/my_dad_44_has_stage_4_cancer_and_im_a_wreck/,1,"Hi everyone, this is my (26f) first post and I’m sorry in advance. I have been depressed severely for the last few years. And I feel I’ve lost my mind, I feel useless. I used to be bubbly and energetic. Now I feel like an empty shell. I was in an abusive relationship and it sent me outside my body, like the old me was gone. I became nothing so I didn’t have to feel what was going on around me. I was raised one of Jehovahs witnesses. My parents divorced when I was five, partially because my dad wanted nothing to do with the religion. Understandable as I have trauma from it. My step dad was an abusive alcoholic and meth user, mostly mentally and emotionally abusive, but also physically to my mom and one of my little sisters. I never got physically abused because I learned from a young age how to be a ‘good little girl’ (more like suppression) and sadly my sister took the brunt of it because she was strong enough to speak up. (im scatterbrained so sorry if I’m jumping around and none of this makes sense) (— I think I have ADHD but I also think I’m dying half the time, I’m very neurotic, anxious etc.) Anyways, I was kicked out on my 18th birthday for confessing to my mom I had been sneaking out to hang out with “worldly people.” You are not allowed to associate with people outside the religion unless it’s for work/business. It’s a cult. My mom thought because of this I was a bad influence on my siblings and didn’t associate with me for years. I went ‘good girls gone wild’ so to speak. Now I carry so much guilt. I’ve had 3 abortions. I’ve slept around, I’ve done drugs and basically have never made a path for myself in life. I was raised not to seek further education or really do anything w my life because the ‘end times’ are so near. My childhood was chaos, my mom had me at 17 and was extremely naive. As am I. Anyways jump forward to now, my dad  has stage 4 cancer and I struggle so much each and every day with depression and I feel like my “sins” burdens my family and I have a hard time talking to my dad and I’m terrified that once he dies it’ll be hard to forgive myself for not spending more time with him. He does live 4 hours away. And we are both socially awkward. He favors one of my sisters, but they play video games together. I just don’t know what to say. I don’t know who I am, I have nothing about me I’d wish to talk about as I feel my decisions in life so far have just made me so mentally ilI I don’t want to burden him. But he’s my dad and he’s still here and Im missing out. And he has nothing to say because for one he doesn’t feel good and it’s just hard for him to talk to me. Anyways there is so much more to the story but it’s hard for me to remember things and I feel more emotional than rational and putting my thoughts together is just difficult. I’m just struggling in many ways and I feel so bad that it’s impacting the last few years I would’ve had to spend with him. It’s not to say I don’t see him, I just wish it was more quality time rather than showing up. I’m very disassociated. He’s had cancer for 3 years now and about a year ago progressed to stage 4 and they told him he had about a year left. Now it’s been a little over a year and he just took us on vacation and we barely talked. My mind isn’t right and I’ve felt pain since a little girl and now I don’t know how to deal with any of it. On top of everything I am unemployed as of February because I told my boss about a coworker (50’sM) who told me he was going to kidnap me and roofie me and hovered over me telling me not to tell anyone. The next day I walk in and was “laid off.” This sent me deeper into depression and my bank account is negative and I just have no will anymore. I hate myself for the things I’ve done and the abortions would be a whole other story but all I can say is for me it sent me into an existential crisis. Idk what I’m asking for I just wanted a safe place to say what’s on my mind.",1680306474.0

listen, I don't belong here. Do you know if I belong here??? Do you know if it's worth it to stay? Would you be mad if I leave this place and meet you up there in Heaven ???? Up there, I hope you see how hard I am trying. I go to work, I go to school still... I am trying MY best. I really am, even if it doesn't look that way. I don't do drugs, I'm not mean. I do what I'm supposed to even if I don't even know wtf I am doing. 

I try to ask him for advice, I don't know if he hears me asking so that's why I write the ghost of him instead.  Who knows if he is anywhere at all. When he died he became my guardian angel, I stopped relying on God or other spiritual things because I felt abandoned. But I really don't think my dad would abandon me. 

So in my letter I literally beg him (my dad, my last string of faith) to help me out, get me tf out of here. I'm not having fun, I'm confused, the world to me feels so not worth it. I can't afford it, I don't fit in blah blah blah- we all have our reasons for being depressed don't we??? I live too much in my head and it's actually not good at all. And when your 10 years deep when do u decide to just move on from this life... I wrote in the letter I can't do it myself. I can't do that to my family nor my friends. I'm supposed to be my best friends maid of honor. My other best friend lost his dad to s word and I don't want to hurt him the same way.  I don't want to leave my brother without a sister. I actually love a lot of things about life very much, I think it's all beautiful, but I just don't fit in. The same way I find cinematography really really cool, but I could never be a film maker myself. 

It's just hard being lost, feeling wrong, and existing in an increasingly scary world.  

I am going to another state soon which I love a lot, and was going to stay longer with my brother but he said ""U know u don't have money for that"" cause I don't. He's right. So why would I stay??? and I ask myself the same question about Earth. I don't have any GOOD reason to stay. Wanting to enjoy things doesn't seem good enough anymore. Idk.

it's my first time writing in this sub. Please bear with me.

I (31f) was recently diagnosed with depression, but I think that I've had it since some time in high school. I remember everyone being joyous for the future to come, while I was driven by anxiety. I never had an actual clue what I wanted to do with my life and felt immense pressure as to not make a mistake. ""Big"" life decisions, am I right? 

My mistake was that I didn't gain much experience prior to making these decisions. It is and always was something I thought I could ""think through"". Doing things actively was always hindered by anxiety and the thought that I could never be as good as others (why?).

I have a BA in Linguistics, because my relatives told me I'm good with languages, yes, I know. I was never that interested in languages. I was actually good in studying and participating in uni classes (not so good in high school, because I was too shy to talk). I tricked me in believing that I wouldn't succeed in anything else, even though I had doubts about the future in this field. 

Because of these doubts, I started a degree to become a teacher in languages. It was the only area, I really gained experience in after high school. 
I obtained a good BA, did good in internships but felt miserable and unsure throughout. I quit and I hate myself so much. At some point, I couldn't focus anymore and everything felt pointless, because I am trapped in this self-induced nightmare.

I'm trapped in constantly having a low self-esteem and, on quite the contrary, thinking I could have achieved ""more"", if I had just tried.

After reading what I wrote, I can't stand myself. How could I fail myself and everyone around me so much?

I know, this is very career-focused. I know there is more to life, but I can't get over how I failed (myself).
I always wanted to find a work that I really enjoy. I was to afraid or else (?) to really search for it. I've lost or never found myself. I don't know.

Even when I had a gf, I didn't fully feel whole.  Last August, my father passed away from a stroke and I went blank.  In September, my gf's father was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, then SHE shut down.  In October, she told me it was over thru text because she had to dedicate her time to her children and dying father, who passed in November.  Now it's April tomorrow, and I have nothing left in me.  My depression has taken a bad turn this past month, I miss my dad tremendously, and when I emailed my ex just to catch up because i miss her, she was very cold since she's going thru depression also, and kept telling me she's a different person, which I took as a sign to leave her alone for good.  The only thing that makes me smile are my children, I've lost any interest in putting myself out on the dating scene, and everything just sucks in general.",1680302142.0

I am halfway through my degree (thankfully, and planning to move back to my hometown in 2 years), but the issue I'm dealing with is my environment and social structure. Everything is lacking and feels out of place. I tried dating apps, and I think it's temporarily filling the void, but there's always a lack of substance. I do what is “deemed” standard, which is to have casual relationships with people, I know it's not good for me, but I do it anyway... Because of impulse issues.

My peers in my class look down on me; I think of myself not highly but decent as a person. But they seem so shallow and want to start gossip and drama. I'm pretty sure they have talked about me behind my back.

I went to see a counsellor and a therapist, and they were useless and disappointing. I struggle with paranoid thoughts and a feeling that people strongly dislike me for no reason. I've put myself out there and talked to people, but it's always been about them, their life, their dreams and goals and not a second to talk about myself properly. 

I'm just so exhausted with everything; I want something real, someone I can connect with emotionally and not feel so alone all the time. Not necessarily romantically, just someone who has my back and is there when I am at my lowest as I have back to anyone else needing support.

Ever since I've been in highschool everything went downhill. I never considered myself depressed but I was really down. I was cutting myself, having multiple mental breakdowns, developped many trauma, wishing my death every day, all that without having the help of anyone, no one knew, no one cared, so I never actually healed from this. Then I met a girl, I was in love with her. Sadly she didn't love back. I spent 9 months having the hope that she would love me back. It never happened. In fact, she left. I was suffocating and totally destroyed. It really didn't help for my mental health. But I had to accept that she was gone and that was it. Much time later, I met another girl. Surprisingly, turned out she liked me, that was the first time a girl liked me. But after that first girl, I didn't want to jump in a relationship just like that, I waited and see how things would go between us. Our first date was amazing, I can't dream of something better. I remember we were sitting right next to each other on top of a abandonned castle in my city, It felt like we were on top of the world. The view was beautiful, but she was even more. She was the most perfect girl I could ever dream of, she was perfect for me, I love her. I love everything about her I can't even describe it, I love who she is. I felt really good just by being with her, it felt like every surroundings didn't matter, like if we were in a bubble and the only thing that mattered was us. She was my angel. For the first time in two years, I wanted to live once again, I could see myself in the future, with her by my side. We promised we would always stay together forever. The first time she came into my house was the best day of my life. We slept together, she was in my arms, that feeling was amazing, I felt peace, love, happiness, all I ever wanted. I wanted to make her happy, and I did, until it lasted. She lost her feelings, she didn't love me anymore. She said that I changed, that she didn't recognize me, I was so confused, I didn't understand. Maybe I wasn't meant for her ? Maybe I wasn't enough for her ? I was lost. Suddenly, all my fantasy sinked to hell. I lost my will to live, once again. I just can't live for myself. I hate myself. Maybe I needed to love myself before loving her ? But that doesn't even matter, because it's too late. I hate myself even more. I just wanted to be with her. I got back into selfharm, the only confort I got. When we stopped talking, that was the worst part, i think it was even worse than when she told me she didn't love anymore, because I can't even go near her now. She got closer to one of my closest friend, they're just friends but it still hurts seeing them spent time together, I feel left behind with no one. For her birthday, I still wanted to give her a gift, so I gave my friend the gift so he could give it to her. In the evening she sent me a text, she called me a psychopath and then she insulted me. I just wanted to make her happy, I'm never giving anyone a gift again. I am so lost. I don't know what to do anymore, I have ""friends"" that I can't even trust, never felt so alone. I just want to end it all. I have no purpose in staying here. I have no goal in life. I feel like i'm already dead mentally, just need to end it physically now.

# 23, Male, mainly in Dallas TX.

Long story short, Got into a car accident that wasn't my fault back in June 2021 and just today I got my settlement check of almost $17K. I did got myself an another car for insurance for $12K but it's completely fucked & got fucked over since the car is now at a junkyard after dealing with shitty mechanics and shittershits that I brought the car from/Took it to another shop to get it worked on and still own $7.5K on a loan that I don't even have the car anymore (Covert of Hutto/Round Rock Hyundai AVOID AT ALL COST) so that leaves me to $9.5K. My mother was handling the situation as the best she can and I owe her $1K for that so that finally leaves me over $8000 I have in my bank account that I can use.

I joined the Army for 6 months (September 2022 - March 2023) only to get discharged (Like I never even enlisted in the first place) because I failed to disclosed some information about being hospitalized for depression back when I was in high-school in 2015-2016 at that time. I did got my certification mechanic when I was at AIT so that's a good thing to help me get a job right away (I hope). Before that I was working at UPS Warehouse far away from where I live (Have to travel by car/truck/motorcycle or else you're fucked) and it wasn't sustainable plus it was 90% outdoor labor. Worked in the Round Rock HUB for nearly 3 years (September 2019 - March 2022) before I had to move to Dallas with my mother and worked in Mesquite HUB for 5 months (April 2022 - September 2022). Half of the time I travel with my own car before all this bullshit accident happen to me and I had my family and friends to help me get to work and back before they start to get tired of me going back and forward for them. Now that I have a certification mechanic I might can work at these jobs more... Just that I don't have any transportation to take me again because I got fucked over before. I really don't want any cars/trucks/motorcycles to own right now due to my limited budget and recent events to trust people at this point of my life. Catching the bus or taking an uber is expensive in the sub-urban part of Dallas TX which I fucking despise sub-urbs now. So I am just a sitting duck with a bit of cash with me without any debts at this point of my life. 

&#x200B;

Currently I am living with my mother while she is supportive, the writing is on the wall that I need to do something in my life. She's an emotional mess like me, and I don't know how she feels at time because at one point she's happy and the other point she just lashed out to anyone at anything if something is not right. I understand why she act like this but it's just too much for me when she is upset. I don't really talk to her like much (Or if anybody if that matters) because I can't come up with anything to say unless it's a topic I really know about. It's easier for me to take my time and type out shit like this unlike engaging in conversations IRL and make it just awkward for me and the person that I am taking with. We recently talked about me not opening my mouth and my mother was furious at me doing that. And give it a plus when I do something random and trying to figure out the situation without pissing my mother off... Yea I don't think I can live with her for much longer.

&#x200B;

So I have some options that I thought off in my head right now:

1. Continue to work at local jobs that is down the street while obtaining a bike or some kind to get me front and back to work.
2. Selling most of my things that I have in my possessions (It's not a lot, it's mainly my 8 year old desktop with some still desired parts for some reason and my aging consoles) and move out of the USA all together because I really fucking hate this country for a while. It's my final straw for this shithole.
3. Moving out of my mothers house and selling most of my shit that I have to live somewhere in Dallas or to another state entirely. I don't know where to go but I will just go at a random direction at this point in my life.
4. Becoming a shut in till my mother kicks me out of the house, then take all the shit I have with me and live in the woods and hope that some animal or something that can kill me. I don't have the courage to kill myself with a firearm nor stabbing myself in the chest with a sharp knife.

586,Confused and just need some advice,1,1285cza,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1285cza/confused_and_just_need_some_advice/,1,"I'm hurt, lost and depressed. I'm a 21 y/o male and I'm lost trying to find some help in my rollercoaster of a life. I've been a stoner since 13 and have tried and am trying to quit right now but it's a lot harder than I though it would be, I quit nicotine about 10 months ago, and I'm not a big drinker. 

 I graduated from high school and went straight to a university because that's the normal and my brother did it so I thought i had to too, hated it so i dropped out, tried a tech school, I didn't fully get along with that school's policies so I thought it would be best to drop out all together.  I'm currently a gym manager pursuing body building.

 I've always been in the gym so I thought about trying something that I've done for so long and so far so good. I just don't have motivation to continue in life. I would love to be Mr. Olympia and use that drive to help get me through my day to day but other than that, I don't really have a lot to drive me in life. 

I'm in a relationship that I'm not super happy in, we've been best friends for 5 years now and in a relationship for the last year and a half and at first everything was well but over the past 6 months its been dragging me down. She's loyal and supportive but I'm not really sexually attractive to her anymore which has destroyed our bed life. There are other things like family dynamics. She's also dealing with her own problems which i think are worse than mine. That, i think, is a reason i find it hard to talk to her sometimes as well. 5 years of time is so much time to throw away which is why I'm reluctant and am still in it. We have a weird best friend kind of dating relationship but where we can kind of talk to each other but I feel weird talking to her sometimes or saying babe or cute nicknames like that just kind of feel weird saying. She is possessive, I am barley allowed to talk to girls without getting an attitude which is kind of annoying because I'm a little socially awkward but i get along with girls better than guys. Because of that, I reduced the amount of people I talk to to just her and a few others that are kind of friends but are more people I know and get along with.

My previous relationship kind of screwed my over and I'm still trying to manage it. 2 years ago I had a girl who I was madly in love with, I wanted a family with her, i wanted to marry her but she told me I wasn't her priority and that she wanted the whole college experience which really hurt me. That, along with my ex best friend in my ear telling me to break up and being impulsive in general, I ended up ending the relationship. As for my ex best friend, we had a Minecraft server together and were sharing the monthly payments of $60, well one month I wasn't able to pay because I took a beach trip and I'm not amazing at managing money and he knew that but he flipped on me. I got a loan from my parents to send to him but apparently it was too late and it was the principle that I didn't pay him on time. It was a Minecraft server, I'm not super good at money management but it also wasn't on the top of my priority because worst case we just cancel our subscription. Well a couple months after both of those ended, I was going through vsco and saw them kissing. My heart sunk and I haven't been able to go on that app since I saw that. I haven't reached out to them and they haven't reached out to me. Every time i think about it, i miss her, hate him but just hurt inside. I don't want either one of them back but they still live in my mind rent free and I really need to start collecting rent from them. 

 I've tried looking into getting a therapist but the ones that I've called said that they wouldn't take me or that their schedule is full which is understandable but its very off putting. Everyone is like oh get a therapist and i thought it would be as easy as calling a few and setting up your appointment but its not at least for me. My motivation is like a roller coaster and is slowly dwindling. There was a point were I wanted to try to have a better mental state and i still do but one thing or one thought comes around and just wipes away my motivation to do anything. I know I'm not alone but I do feel alone. I know I shouldn't be chasing happiness but what can I do to help my motivation?",1680308575.0

have a on/off relation with depression since 2005

dont know where to start so here a backstory

belong to a well to do family, was doing good till high school junior then suddenly lost interest in studying altogether in my senior year.

my parents were angry because my professor caught me skipping classes for around a month. all seems hazy afterwards. I just remember my parents asking teachers by giving some reason for my absence and most of teachers understood. some how i even passed high school that was a shocker for me.

parents had some expectations from me that i could not fulfill due to low grade in HS, instead going for a UG program went for the associate degree and did pass it with good grade.

During AD program i go to make a bunch of good friends and I was the one in the group who would be genuinely lost without them. But leaving them just created a new social anxiety version in me.

during the UG program did not know or understand where to go ended up enrolling a program which i would leave midway causing financial problem for my parents. In addition to not understanding what was being taught, I was full on afraid to even enter the college premise. here too I skipped classes and ended up ruining my chance for a good life.

this event just pulled me into more depression, the thing haunting me was how will I ever have a good career because of these kind of breaks. lets talk about my parents a little bit. the both got married late and had my sibling and me late in their life. My parents were doing namesake well so we didnt have any financial problem but still me being unable to give them a good retired life will haunt me to death.

 back to me somehow I got into another distance education along with a hardware and networking based program. so I did it and after few months of completion got a new job were I had been working for the past 10 years. just gave up the job last year.

there is a problem with me. I have social anxiety, so going out and meeting people is not my strong point. have lost genuine interest in the job i had because because i was a genuine pussy for not trying to find another job and that has harmed my current situation. I dont have relevant knowledge in my field and that blocks many job opportunities for me.

am trying to learn new things and land some good job for now. there have been multiple moments where i think it would be better if i was off but then thinking about my parents and leaving them alone in their age is wrong. this previous job has been keeping me busy but still the thought would lurk around me every time.

I am in my mid 30s, no gf, no good job, aged parents worried about me and vice versa, really lost in my life looking in the mirror asking myself what actually i want. looking back at my colleagues and old friends all settled with kids, good job or own business. in comparison i am lost. Im not a smart or an intelligent person and i am always comparing myself to other people who are doing well and it just breaks my spirit everytime.

feels like if i had chance to start again from back then.. but then have to take care of myself today in this now world.",1680284091.0

I (F22) Could go on all day about how shit life has been for me. From a child i was emotionally and verbally abused. I never had a very good relationship with my mother.

A couple years ago she decided she couldn't go on anymore, but not before first trying to take me out as well.

My family has not been helpful. Other than about one family member who has been in and out of my life, i have been practically left alone since my mother passed away. It has caused me to feel isolated, majorly depressed, and helpless. I've tried multiple times to let people around me know that i am NOT doing okay and i am quiet literally crashing, but my family only offers prayers and then i never hear from the majority again. Even after being hospitalized twice since my tragedy, for some reason my family have decided to keep themselves at a distance. I often feel jealous when other members my same age get uplifted and supported, when I quite literally almost died and have had to figure things out on my own since 17.

I have no relationship with my other siblings, struggling to provide basic needs for myself, and i do not have any friends. All I do is go to work and come home and repeat.

I have been putting up with them for 3 years, and living with them is becoming more of a pain everyday. I am building up the courage to basically give my godauntie as my Payee, to help me find a place.


Things she commonly says are the following:

""You must be 21 and not 18+ to rent out an apartment""

_ ""They'll raise the rent on you, like Harmon Hills did, watch""

- You don't have enough (Even through months worth of checks are saved up on my card, even it hasn't been touched.)

I know if I keep consistent, I'll end up going somewhere but it is tiring. I'm fighting my demons but sometimes I do feel like why do I bother even trying? Some days I do feel like I'm overcoming my depression and feel proud of myself, and I do have a few friends supportive of me but when the crash really hits, god damn is it difficult to set my mentality straight again.

Dying just sounds so much easier right? I feel like I could jump off this window and I'd be peaceful. Is it even worth it in the end? There's no certainty that I won't end up alone and miserable as I am today no matter how much I try

I signed up for a DnD club meeting tomorrow and it sounds fun but the anxiety is killing me again. Why did I sign up for it?

Recently though I’ve been feeling odd. I have made some friends (and I’m so great full for them, they are a wonderful lot) however I am not “myself” around them. My reactions are always underwhelming and I can’t seem to get out much emotion when having a conversation. I have tried to put in more enthusiasm but I’ve just come across as weird when I did that. Also I’ve been called “depressed” by my peers and professors. I’ve also been feeling completely worthless and don’t think I’ll amount to much in life. I suddenly have had thoughts of “I’m not gonna plan to live very long”. Additionally, I’ve been super disinterested in my favourite courses and even my exam grades have dipped severely. 
I think I hit most of the criteria but I still feel like I can’t figure out what’s wrong with me. Is it a burnout, is it depression?

Constant mental torture and abuse. She gossips and talks crap about me all day with people and when someone comes over to the house she cries to them and plays victim and then also calls my husband and cries to him. She has basically tried to ruin my life in every aspect. I can’t leave from here because im not financially independent and my husband says that it’s temporary. 

In all of this suffering I made a friend who I thought was very supportive of me in the beginning. I told her everything that i was going through. We would go out all the time and i would feel better. 3 weeks ago my mil had the biggest fight/argument with me. I haven’t spoken to her since. It was so bad to the point where i was feeling the lowest I’ve ever felt in a long time. I was suicidal, not eating for 48 hrs straight etc. i went to go stay at my friends house for a night and she was very supportive of me.

I just stood in the middle of the room, trying to understand what I was doing here, why I was doing it. It turns out some kind of crap, not a normal text. It is difficult to describe now, but I know that it will be worse, I know that soon I will have problems with my appetite, I will lose my psychological need for sleep and the only way to fall asleep will be absolute exhaustion, I will stop being happy for anything and will start to fear people like fire. This is how everything will happen.   
 And it's not that I didn't try to prepare, I tried to go to a psychiatrist, but I don't have all the documents to go to a hospital in a human way. Then I came across the number of psychological support and I was advised by several doctors that I can contact directly, two of them do not accept patients, and now... I just may not have the courage to contact those who are left. Shit, that last time nearly killed me, or so I thought. But I definitely have more scars now.

Idk if these are symptoms of  depression or not but I've been in this state for almost 3-4 years starting when I was in grade 10. I can switch my moods in a sec, like from extremely over the moon to crying my eyes out for no reason. I can literally eat 2000-3000 cals a day for a week and starve myself for a month and it keeps happening like a cycle. I can have the most motivation for 1-2 weeks and then completely lose it for 1 month and again it occurs like a cycle. I don't know how to get rid anything of those, I feel like I wasted my 17,18,19 and half 20 for nothing. I got good grades but it seems like I don't know what I'm studying for. I've never had a bf before and I terribly want one:( Whenever I start having a feeling for someone, thoughts of breaking up or reasons I shouldn't date the guy keep popping up in my head and I literally cannot have a crush on anyone for more than 1 month. My parents are so nice to me, they always care about me, to the point that they never trust me, now idk this is ironic or normal sentence, they've never given me a feeling that I'm good enough. It makes me a perfectionist like who I am today, I've never felt satisfied with everything I do, I always always believe that everything I do is either wrong or not good enough, that's why I have a stressful life all the time. I never want to confide any of my worries to anyone, I'm scared of bothering them, I hate spreading negativity to others (sr for making you read all of these) but I feel that I'm getting so close to my limits now. There are no days  that I don't cry, I must cry, idk why but I must cry at least 1 per day at night before I fall asleep. I remember my painful past stories of being bullied, being discriminated, I've never told any of these to anyone, I'm an outgoing person in everyone's eyes, I always keep everything to myself, I don't have guts to share my real feelings, to face my fears, I've been running from them my whole life. Sometimes I wish I was never born, maybe my family wouldn't have to bear such a burden like me. Okay that's it. Thanks for reading till this point. I'd appreciate that. Thanks again and sorry if this provokes any negativity inside you. I didn't mean to do that, sorry:(",1680244756.0
649,Understanding depression in the context of hunter gatherer civilization,1,127mp56,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/127mp56/understanding_depression_in_the_context_of_hunter/,0,"I think when we have any emotional discomfort it helps to frame it in the context of early human culture. For example today we might feel depressed and we say it's because we are failures, we don't make enough wealth, or we might not have what we expected from ourselves. 

I think it's also important to note that in recent news even Tom Brady and Ronaldo have suffered from some depression. These are the most ideally successful people in our world. If even they experience depression then we have to start to understand our own depression by not taking it so personally. In theory if somebody told you that you could have everything that they had, you would most likely say that it'd make you feel better. 

If you look at the average hunter gatherer lifestyle they had a big tribe of around 20-30 people who were all very close with each other. They took care of children as a tribe rather than as individual family units. They gathered food together and served the overall well being of the tribe. I think depression can very much be related to the subconscious feeling that you aren't living the life that our human psychology was sort of programmed to live all those years ago. 

If you study early psychologists like Freud and Jung, they always try to understand modern psychological struggles in the context of these archaic early civilization impulses. 

When I think of some of my happier moments it was usually when I was in a large group of people who interacted together. I enjoy group activities such as sports or when I was in a classroom as a kid. My childhood was great because my extended family was often together. Unfortunately my mother ruined that for us, but it was a really great time. I think depression is related to the lack of having a big group that accepts and supports you. It's not entirely our faults, it's also something we inherit in our current culture. 

That's why depression is so correlated to self esteem because it feels like we aren't doing enough to be accepted into the group. The problem is that in early human culture we were automatically part of the group unless we did something wrong. Alot of us here probably haven't done much wrong which makes us confused psychologically as to why things aren't working out. 

Tom Brady recently adopted a kitten recently, and it's probably because of that lack of a big tribe feeling that sports gave him. I think one way to resolve depression is to sort of try to adopt features of a lifestyle that resembles early human culture. Not exactly the easiest thing to do, but I think if you have an opportunity to bring yourself closer to that type of lifestyle then you should.",1680271830.0

She basically said that my life has value. And when I asked her why she said it just does and to not worry about the why. I'm supposed to just say that to myself but I don't...I don't understand. I try saying it to myself and my brain immediately asks ""Why?""

WHY is my life valuable?? It doesn't make sense. She said that it just does but I don't get that. I could literally die and nothing would happen to the world.

TW, pedophila rape and incest.

I at this moment am taking care of my 9 year old daughter. I originally thought she was my little sister, another one that was forced to suffer under the horrid care of my parents that I didn't know of, I however took the time to do a paternity test, as I felt I needed to for whatever reasoning my subconscious decided it was going to abide by. I wish I hadn't been correct. She was conceived through pedophilic incest and rape, as I was only 9 myself when she was conceived. My mother is her mother as well so you can make the connection yourself, My parents were as you can imagine not exactly the most pleasant individuals, I was forced to rape my own sisters under threat of having a fire-poker put in places I would have never recovered from, I know I wouldn't have survived it because I'm not the eldest of their children, our older brother was killed by them using this exact method of torture and I was forced to watch. The justice system in my country has failed me as when this was all discovered to have happened neither of those monsters were dragged into prison, They were even able to try and get me back at 16, rather the judge decided they could heal and become good people, or they lied convincingly enough that they got off scot-free, though at the very least we weren't forced to stay, my sisters and I were taken from my parents and we left, different family members took us, my Uncle took me but not my sisters since they wanted nothing to do with me, I couldn't blame them. My Uncle was an amazing man who himself suffered from depression but lost his fight with it, at the start of the year.I watched my best-friend slowly die from a brain bleed after she cracked her skull open on a side rail down a flight of stairs in her own home, She didn't want to die and I tried my best to comfort her as she cried for her Dad but I doubt it worked at the time.

When she was born her mother attempted to kill her, She never wanted to be a mother and at the sight of her daughter she lost her mind, post natal psychosis or however it's spelt. Leaving my best friend with horrific scars, missing her ring fingers and half her face, had brain damage too. I fell in love with my best friend after only a month of meeting her, and at the time she did too. Or at least that's what she told me but we couldn't love each other the way we really wanted to and eventually I was forced to leave her behind, while I stayed in contact with her online it wasn't the same. I got a couple visits with her before her accident but that wasn't enough to make either of us happy.

I have a wife, or in the loose sense of the term I do. We didn't married in the legal sense since she's a native Alaskan her culture didn't marry in the same way mine does, I didn't mind though as I still loved her enough to not really mind the culture difference. She got cervical cancer a while before we married but it only started to become a problem a little before the wedding, At the time we thought her missed periods were a pregnancy, but no. She had a massive tumor blocking her up and making a massive amount of rotting blood gather inside her. We were robbed of a honeymoon in Hawaii because of it and she nearly died during the surgery. I was prepared to lose yet another person I loved as I had lost many before and was no stranger to outliving my loved ones. I was lucky however as whatever sadistic monster that influences my life had failed to kill her too, it did however succeed in taking her fertility from her, as she lost her ability to have children because of the surgeries she had to have. I spent my birthday in hospital with her comforting her as she came to terms with the fact she was sterilized. We hoped we could save her ovaries if we got another surgery in the future, Something to hopefully regain her fertility, but after a thorough look over, That hope was destroyed. She will never bare children.

I have no support structure, Everyone I had is either gone or turned against me for one reason or another and I have no one else close enough that I feel I can ask for help from. I have nearly no one and I can't find help. I have no money to spare for therapy and no family to go to. I am alone with the tiny family I still have and I'm desperately holding onto it. I don't want to lose them too. But I have the feeling that whatever has been making this world my own personal hell won't let me have them for much longer. I hate being alive, everyday I fear what I'll wake up to, I fear I'll wake up and my wife will have died from an infection that wasn't treated or that my little girl will have succumb to her mental damage and follow the example of my Uncle. I don't know how much longer I can keep going before I myself give up. I don't want to. I really don't. But I fear I am approaching my limit for how much of this wretched world I can fucking tolerate.

Something about me, I studied civil engineering at high school and i finnished this school with degree, I didnt want to continue in this field because i didnt know what part of this field should i choose and i didnt like it. So for the college i have choosen mechanical engineering because i tought this is the right choice but i hated it after 1 week, i didnt want to quit so fast so i decided that i should try it at least and stay there a bit longer. I made it trough first semester but it was worst than the beginnig of the school year. All what i was doing was sitting in classes and trying to do my best in all subject (i had good marks) but i didnt care about anythink because it was not for me and i didnt see future in it. I couldnt imagine that i am going to do anythink from it. I know that in college there are subjects that are boring but i had only 1 subject that was interesting for me during first semester and now during summer semester i didnt have anythink in my timetable that is at least interesting or useful for me. Also my mental heath started decreasing during college, I was alone all the time, I tried to make friends but everyone had their group from high school and i was outsider. Personally i didnt care that i am alone but everyday i felt hollow. I talked about it with my mom and dad and i told them that i hate it. My dad was supportive and agreed with my decision but my mom was a bit in shock but also she supports me in my decision. I took a day off and rethink my decision, I felt insane pain and i was scared because i didnt know what should i do in my life and i dont know what is my purpose. I tought about it all day long and I decided to give it at least another try so i spended another month in college then i dropped out. I dropped out of college 4 days ago and now i am looking for job, also my sister recommended me to aply for another school and she suggested me IT college, I agreed with her because i spended a lot of time with pc, i eaven built myself pc and i think that i know a few things about pc. I am afraid about codeing but at least i give it a try.

Now here it comes my biggest problem, I am lost in life. I dont know what to do. I dont know what type of job is good for me, I am scared that because of my decision i will live misserable life. Everyone just thinks that bachelores degree is so important but for me it is not. I am so much scared of the future, past and present. Things that i enjoyed so much in my free time were playing games with my friends from highschool on discord, watching movies and in general spending time with my family. Now i cant stop thinking about everythink what i have done, I cant watch movie without pain and anxiety, I cant call my friends because i feel paralysed. I cry almost every night when i go to sleep. I feel horible all day, only if i fall asleep i can rest. I am so tired of it.  I have never went to therapist in my life but now i am considering it. I could just spend 1,5 months going to school but i would feel bad for my parents because i would quit it anyway. I try to keep moving forward but how can i move forward if i dont see my next step or destination.

After all of it what i wrote i feel at least a bit better, also i would like to know if someone had same problems as me or if you know anything what could help me it will be very kind of you.

I’m 29F and have gone through a lot since childhood. I have PTSD, anxiety, and major depressive disorder and went through childhood neglect, physical and mental abuse, sexual abuse, sexual assault, and relationship abuse.

I’ve been in therapy since I was 22 and have been on medication for a while. It was working but nothing really takes the daily pain away. I am also back to depression. I’m exhausted.

I read about equine therapy and it made me wonder what other alternative methods are out there if any. From what I read equine therapy can be expensive so it’s not really an option at least at the moment.

We didn't speak for over a month and I was really hurt. I was in middle of this whole shifting to a new city, starting a new job, and when the thing happened between us, it left me very anxious and lonely. 

Finally when we had a chance to talk, I told her what hurt me and she said drained her out with accusations. I really don't know how else I could have told her things. I have been very vulnerable for very long and alone in this new city. I tried talking to her but she avoided talking and claimed everything was fine.

I am the person who needs to speak things out loud to feel better. Last night she said that ""you said I've wronged you but I don't know how"". I am a bit slow in catching things up, in understanding what people really mean when they say certain things. My first cue is to apologize immediately when someone says I've wronged them and not try to justify my actions and mean it when I do so. It hurts when it doesn't happen the other way around.

I am trying to be okay with everything but there are days when everything seems slipping out of my hand. I know she herself has been going through a lot and probably I put more burden on her. I just wish things didn't have to go so wrong. I think I will step back from her life. It hurts that we came to this but it is what it is.",1680258044.0

I'm not sure what to do right now, and the only thought that has been on my head ever since then is how wonderful it would be to fall asleep and not wake up.

I've had a few jobs, recently got a degree. I had to quit my last work-from-home job last month not because of the job per se but because I felt so invalidated by family members. Some said it was ""not a real job"", and I kept on getting dragged to family trips and social events in spite of my workload. It caused me to have anxiety-panic symptoms for a whole month before I decided to quit everything: work, socialization, I want nothing to do with the outside world. That worked and my anxiety lessened considerably. I wasn't going to bed feeling like I'm gonna have a heart attack or my head will explode.

Please don't tell me to get a job, a hobby, or a pet. Or any of the usual go to pop psychology, feel good advice. I've tried everything from therapy, meds, reading psychology, philosophy, spiritual books. I've tried improving myself, meeting more people, doing more things. That's not it. I want something deeper. My whole life I craved connection, not just attention or acceptance or even help but real deep connection. And yes I can be very needy to the point of even toxic. I will be the first to admit that. But does that mean I don't deserve a best friend or a lover?

I played the game, I worked my ass off to make it in life, played nice, cared for my friends as much as I could. All for nothing. I wouldn't mind being a failure in my career if I actually had best friends, someone to have deep conversations with and with who I don't have to mask. I've been masking all my life and when I learned about the term, it was too late to change. I could smile at people I abhor, I'm so heavily socialized that I seem neurotypical at first. And then people would expect me to do normal things and I would fail. And they would assume that I'm lazy or a terrible person. I'm so sick and tired of dealing with those kinds of people, and I shouldn't have to because they won't be a big part of my life.

I like to talk about feelings and spiritual topics, that is, if I find something cool, it's usually something deeper than aesthetic or skill. It could represent something in my life or worldview. People generally don't even go there so I'm stuck, either I neglect my preferences to get along with others, or I stay alone. It's so lonely. It doesn't help that I'm religious and have controversial beliefs. I just keep that to myself.

I am so emotionally crushed right now that all the creature comforts in the world won't make me feel better. You could put me in paradise and I'd still be crying, I wish I were like the other autistics who could make it alone, just enjoying their special interests. It's not like that for me, I've always wanted to share my world with other people, I want to tell them things I found interesting, what touched me and why. I think I would need at least two people, one for shared interests and long, intense conversations, and one to love deeply and wholeheartedly without having to pretend to be less needy or toxic. I don't need to be with them all the time but at least daily I need some sort of validation.

I am so sick and tired of watering down my emotions just so I can talk to people, and avoiding topics and opinions I like because people will get upset or offended. They keep on getting surprised, even hurt when they find out what I'm really all about. I hate it. I don't want to change, I can't change, I already tried that mindset and it's full of self-hate, which makes things worse.

I've honed my writing skills to the point where I am so direct and transparent, and people still think I'm using pretty words to manipulate or have ulterior motives. It hurts so much because I worked on this all my life. My spoken communication isn't half as good and my listening and empathizing suck as well. But that doesn't mean I'm not a real person, or that I'm not being honest. Even apologizing and asking questions was interpreted as something bad, there's just no way to get through to someone. This is hopeless.

I'm freaking crying again today. I think I can only connect deeply with females, I don't mean to be sexist but the biological basis for it is real, women want to connect, communicate more, and are more emotional. It's hard to connect with boys on the feelings side of things, and I'm also afraid of men exploiting my weaknesses.

In short, I'm at that point where I can't move forward in other aspects of life until I've resolved the issues of feeling unwanted, invalidated, unloved, and not having safe persons I can confide in and share my world with. I wouldn't make such a drastic decision if I didn't have to, I was literally getting sick from anxiety and depression. 

I know I am very heavy and unhealthy, possibly toxic too but I'm desperate. I can't take it anymore. I'm thinking of dying, if I don't belong with anyone then what's the point of being alive? This pain won't go away, it hurts in the chest and it's getting harder to do my self-care again. 

I don't know how long I can stay sane enough to write down like this how I'm feeling, so I'm sorry if I'm rambly or if I get touchy in the comments. I have nowhere else to go but the internet now.  
Thanks for reading. I don't know what would actually help, short of a couple of miracles...",1680175511.0

I'm almost 50, and I've been self-aware of my deep depression for about 40 years. I think I'm addicted to the pain of my existence, both mental and physical. Every injury or mental scar seems to make me more steeled,  callous, and adds more inner rage. It's like the hatred of life fuels me to take on more pain. I'll never directly kill myself, but I won't do anything to avoid death or change my habits. I don't want to be 'better'.

I don't drink or do drugs anymore, (other than weed once in a great while). I feel like those things numb my pain - except for weed when I want to draw, listen to music, and churn up the ghosts of my past. I like hanging out with those ghosts in my head - places that have disappeared with time, family and friends who've died or been lost along the way, and things that I'm made of that others can never relate to.

I have friends and family that would like to hang out, but I'm 'happiest' when I'm alone. So, I generally hang out with someone maybe once every couple of weeks (and I only live 5-10 minutes away from most of them).

I guess I'm writing this to relate to others, and anonymous text is safe. In a strange way, that makes me realize I'm probably lonely because nobody I know directly relates with who I am.

In the depths of depression, it's not uncommon to feel completely alone in the world. You may feel like nobody understands what you're going through, and that there's no hope for things to get better. These feelings of hopelessness can be incredibly difficult to overcome, and can leave you feeling trapped in a dark and terrifying place.

However, it's important to remember that depression is a treatable condition. There are many effective therapies and medications available that can help alleviate the symptoms of depression and help you start to feel like yourself again. It's also important to seek out support from loved ones or a mental health professional, as the road to recovery can be challenging and it's important to have a strong support system in place.

While depression can be a difficult condition to deal with, there is always hope for a brighter future. With the right treatment and support, it's possible to overcome the darkness of depression and start living a happier, more fulfilling life.",1680251840.0

But

The last month has been pretty good for me. In a way, I have improved my relationship with my parents, my social relationships, and my relationship with myself. 

I have visited many places, I have done activities that excite me, I learned to express my emotions and manage them better than before, and now I no longer cry to the point of having panic attacks or fantasize about suicide every day in my bathroom. 

Everything got better when my principal realized that I was at least 5 hours late for school crying, because last day I tried to kill myself, and failed. 

I opened up my feelings to her, and all of that resulted in a talk with my parents and they tried to help me to ""get better."" 

And in a certain way they did, but that support has lasted a maximum of 1 week. 

And it hurts  me to admit it, because many people have tried to help me, but now, that in a certain way I am better, my life is boring. 

Yes, I do miss crying every day and getting sentimental about everything, I miss the pain all over my body from not eating, I miss counting calories all the time in my head, I miss feeling tired all the time, I miss being alone, I miss that nobody knows what I was suffering and that they thought that everything was fine, I miss being pale all the time, I miss that my favorite things like music passionate me at my worst moments, I miss getting showers at night to distract myself from everything, I miss hating how I look with everything I try on, I miss crying myself to sleep, I miss being in the same horrible routine every day, I miss that everything always went wrong for me, I miss wanting to kill myself every day for everything that happened to me, I miss arguing with my parents every day, I miss having panic attacks, I miss not having any friends, I miss no one noticing or giving a shit about me, I miss feeling scared of my parents, I miss that and many more things, 

I miss everything. 

I miss being depressed.
 
I hate being happy. 

Somehow, I feel that now that I am happy all the time, that everything is going well for me, I no longer enjoy the small moments that made me feel pleased before, I see them as something normal. It's as if my happiness has brought me into something worse than depression.

I’ve always thought that if I finally got happy, I’ll feel complete in this fucked up world. I didn’t. 

Feeling depressed made me feel “complete” in some way

Maybe in my own way

I hate being happy now. It’s the thing I’ve always been searching but I hate it. Everything’s just off

I have not told anyone about this because I don’t wanna sound ungrateful because they have helped me get through it and because “it’s not good for me” and I’ll be betraying my old self, I literally just got everything I’ve been searching in life, but I hate it

I miss being depressed 

I just feel I enjoyed life more

I tried to enjoyed every second because I always though 

“Maybe I won’t have this tomorrow”

Now that I’m “happy” everything’s just the same. all the time. I don’t have nothing to fight for. 

But the horrible routines’s still here,

It’s just that now it’s all:

Every day is perfect, everyone is perfect

Boring.

I want something to be wrong again

I want to feel human again

I want to feel more emotions than just happiness and happiness

I feel like a robot

I really don’t like doing anything anymore

And I don’t want to spend the rest of my years like this

Is happiness this boring?

Is life this boring then?

But I know I don’t have to be feeling this, because everyone has tried to help me, even myself

I don’t know what to do about it. 

I’ve gotten to the point I don’t enjoy anything anymore, and my most special thing ever, one of the reasons I’m still alive, music, doesn’t feel the same anymore.

I don’t get the same joy, I don’t feel absolutely identified with what music expresses, I don’t feel safe with it, I don’t enjoy every fucking note and second of it, and that is fucked up

I love music, my most special thing is this world, and happiness is ruining it in al the ways possible

First of all, I’d like to say hello to everyone here. 

I’m not sure if this is the right place to look for the answers I need, but I’ll try in different places. 

Due to recent circumstances in my life, I’ve been forced to reflect on different aspects of it. I fell into a severe depression and I started to suffer strong anxiety and identity crises; however, this post isn’t about that. These thoughts have been making me ask myself things like “what is depression?” and “what is misfortune]?”, but not in the biological or literary sense of the word. 

I’m talking too much so I’ll just go straight to the point: I need you guys to help me materialize these concepts by relating them to objects, situations, smells, pains, etc. I’d like to understand them on a deeper level. Help me romanticize depression. Funny, isn’t it? What is depression to you? Why is it like that? I’d love to read you guys.

Hugs to anyone who needs it.",1680238933.0

729,"Just feeling down, dejected, hopeless, and completely discouraged.",1,127aewk,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/127aewk/just_feeling_down_dejected_hopeless_and/,1,"I feel like I'm starting to self sabotage, I don't know.  I've been stuck spinning my wheels for like 10 years after things really screwed up my education and just having no idea how to get back on track or what I even want to do.  My first choice of career I was great at it but ended up completely miserable to the point I'd rather die or be homeless than go back to that.  Now I finally felt like I'm on the right path but I just know it isn't gonna work out.  I had a job interview today that I felt went really great, but I'm afraid I'm just gonna be miserable there and that it's not gonna be something I can balance with school the way I thought I could when I applied.  They had me taking a problem solving skills test that made me feel extremely stupid and bad at math, things I used to do instantly in my head are now things I have to think about or even write out.  So now I'm afraid I'm gonna blow it if I do get back to school.

I feel like I'm making no progress in the gym.  I've been dealing with a long term wrist and knee issue, when I finally got back to the gym and felt like I was making progress then I had to stop when my knee flared up.  Now that I'm back, I feel like all my progress was undone and then some.  Some nights, including tonight, I feel like I just have zero energy and am weak as hell so it feels like a complete waste of time and is just so discouraging.  I just keep losing weight no matter how much I eat and lift.  I'm literally lifting less weight than when I first got back to the gym 9 months ago and that was after like 10 years away from it.  It's like I'm going backwards.  I kinda want to just hop on gear and see if that can get me to a point where I'm happy with my body and where I can continue to progress.

I thought my knee, which causes constant pain and keeps me from playing any sports, was finally going to be operated on.  But the last surgeon I saw just said he sees no reason for surgery and told me I need to push myself harder on strengthening.  I was already pushing myself insanely hard, now I'm doing my best to push even harder but it feels impossible and feels like I'm making no progress.  Sports are pretty much my life and my knee has kept me from them for like 10 years now.

I met a woman who I've really clicked well with.  She's the first woman in a very long time that I've been interested in anything besides sex.  She has the same type of humor I do, she sees so many things the way I do.  I honestly have a hard time meeting anyone that I actually like enough to even be good friends with.  Things were going really really well and I thought the vibe was very clearly one where we're moving towards an actual relationship.  Then after what I thought was a great night that's gonna lead to the next step it ended up leading to her telling me that a relationship isn't something she's looking for any time soon.  It feels like a case of right person wrong time all over again, which is something that's totally crushed me before.

I just know none of these things are gonna work out and I'm just gonna be right back to being miserable and feeling like a failure in a bunch of different ways.  I don't even know if there's really anything anyone can say to help at all, I just thought maybe it would help to get it all out and towards people that could empathize.  When I talk to my family about it, it's just ""you're worrying too much, everything will be fine"".",1680237907.0

741,Everyday the weight and addiction to competition gets more tiring.,1,1279ets,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1279ets/everyday_the_weight_and_addiction_to_competition/,1,"I'm going to be vague since I don't really like talking about it at all but I feel comfortable with a sense of anonymity here.  


For basically my whole life I've always been an extremely competitive person, I always would practice something simply so I could be better than the people I knew and excel at something, I've done that for multiple things like swimming, chess, and now, for the past couple years video games have been the thing I've been addicted to.

&#x200B;

Depression took over my life ever since COVID started and I've gotten through so many highs and lows and I don't know how I'm still here now-a-days but I guess I can attribute this to a sense of purpose in my competitiveness, I've delved into competitive fighters and it really gave my otherwise purposeless and dull life a purpose.

&#x200B;

But at the same time it's a double edged sword because anytime things don't go the way I expect them / assume they'll go (and that happens a lot) I just go on self destructive rants, I toss shit, I slam my laptop over and over, and it's some of my lowest points for sure, it's just painful seeing yourself regress even with all the work you put into practicing something and being sometimes even worse than you were a couple weeks ago.

&#x200B;

I've been avoiding the topic with my therapist for probably a solid half year now because it's just so uncomfortable for me to talk about, I never mention this to anyone I know IRL, and when I say no one I mean no one, it's mostly just friends inside the community and online people, where I feel less exposed.

&#x200B;

People have been begging me to just talk about it with them but I always feel like they're gonna tell me something I don't wanna hear that like I should stop playing and go do something I enjoy more, hang around my uni friends more, and the shitty part is he's right, I always feel better when I'm not playing this dogshit game but I just can't let go.

&#x200B;

I don't wanna let go, I've made a promise to myself ever since I knew what competition was that I wanted to be the best, and I didn't want to half ass or give up on anything I'm passionate about, and I'm extremely passionate about this but how passionate is too passionate, when does passion become harmful.

&#x200B;

When I was younger I was the type of kid to keep to himself, I was very shy and didn't have many friends inside or outside of school aside from a small group of 3 I'd eat lunch with. At family gatherings I had a constant feeling of anxiety and tried my hardest to avoid people when possible; I never felt any connection to family and it was awkward for me trying to form relationships with these people who I only saw once every 2-3 years and barely remembered each time.

I think because of that I always suppressed my emotions and avoided being too honest with my opinions and how I feel about certain things, on top of being a dude and feeling like I oughta be embarrassed about my feelings. So I can't really remember too many instances when I'd cried in my younger years.

Right now, I'm a college dropout staying at home with my mom, uncle, great-aunt, and stepfather: all of whom I have very little connection to (I sincerely don't think I've had a conversation with any of them in years). I'm looking for jobs right now since I got fired from my last job in December and I want to move out as soon as I'm financially able to. I feel like I've been a burden this past year and everyone'd be glad if my presence wasn't looming around this house and my bedroom. My sisters both left after having individual falling-outs with our mom and I know she hasn't pressured me to leave because she feels like I wouldn't come back, like them. I feel like I'm a piece of shit whose taking advantage of that to live life rent-free, but I really do want to leave and seek my independence, I just never thought I'd be capable of doing so.

Anyway, the subject of this post: I noticed when I was watching a Youtube video dubbing a comic series and it got to the end of this long arc and the day was saved. The entire 15 minutes leading up to the finale I was on the verge of tears and ended up breaking down at the end of it. Then when I saw a clip of Adventure Time on TikTok, I started tearing up too. It wasn't even anything emotional, just from an old episode I liked. The same thing happened with a Steven Universe clip on youtube, a few songs, when I rewatched the Spongebob movie, out of nowhere when I was making breakfast, again out of nowhere when I went out for a morning walk. I just don't know what it is, but I've been crying maybe 2 or 3 times a day these past 2 weeks and I only realized after typing out the things above that maybe I should see a therapist to work through some stuff but I just don't know. For awhile I've had this constant weird feeling in the back of my head and in my chest and I've had some suicidal thoughts too, not sure if I have depressions or something but it's been sucky for awhile and I think I just needed an excuse to let some stuff out without consequence.

759,Can depression cause a partner to fall out of love and break things off? How to find balance of contact to show I care without being overbearing to her?,15,126jbsa,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/126jbsa/can_depression_cause_a_partner_to_fall_out_of/,6,"My ex broke things off recently, partly mental health but partly how I was dealing with her bad days. She lost her 2 year old son 3 years ago and has only just accepted help for it. She’s also taken time off work after witnessing a little boy passing away late February in the hospital she works and she recently miscarried our baby 2 weeks ago. 

This is new to me and I’ve not had experienced living with a partner who has depression so I’ve assisted to her mental health problems such as taking her bad moments personally and walking out the room, we were in the city and she was feeling ill and I tried to comfort her but she told me to “f*ck off” which made me walk off from her (i hate myself for doing this).

All this led to her breaking things off and going back to her mums where her comfort zone is but she told me she “loves me but isn’t in love with me” and was angry when I backed off after the breakup saying i’m supposed to be supporting her but it seems I can’t run away quick enough. That my actions don’t meet my words and that I’ not emotionally strong enough to deal with her situation (which is correct so I’m addressing these issues with therapy).

I gave off the wrong impressions and this is new to me but I want to support her through this. I recently sent her a heartfelt letter about wanting to support her and apologising for how I dealt with everything.

She called the next day and was calmer, open to the idea of me being there but my actions had to match my words. She gave me a list of things she wanted me to work on whilst she got therapy for her grief and depression and said lets see where we both are in 6-12 months.

We last spoke on Tuesday and I plan to drop her a light hearted message to try and make her smile at the weekend.

How often should I reach out to her to show I care but to also not invade her space too much? She likes to be in her own world a lot of the time. I want my actions to meet my words like she says but not sure on the balance of contact?",1680173561.0

I don't spend a lot of time talking to other depressed people because I don't really relate to them but I need advice.

If anyone has any advice on coping with having to do stuff everyday, I'm all ears! Like taking a shower, dishes, vacuuming, and stuff. I mean, I do do everything as needed like I vacuum daily, dishes immediately, shower every other day, do hobbies, spend time with friends, ect. I've tried food rewards, fabric rewards, baking rewards, new hiking sites rewards, going on vacation, and more stuff. It doesn't work very well. I've gone to therapy for depression and all the therapist does is suggest things everyone already knows and I've tried. I do try them again since the therapist is a professional and knows what they're doing, but I'm not progressing. I feel just as depressed at 30 as I did at 10.

Also, not really related but I'm pissed that my current therapist asked my ""why"" I went on vacation overseas if it didn't make me happy. Like, she suggests stuff like going to gym classes, making friends, and doing new hobbies. So it's for the same reason she suggested that stuff. To spend my time until I finally get to die at an old age because I can't just sit here forever. I mean, I have a ton of issues that need to be worked on one at a time, but everything has to come from within. It's such a waste of money for me, I feel. Just because I haven't been suggested anything new or gotten help from them with what they suggest (make friends! Okay, how?) and stuff.

I work extremely hard at my job for a pharmacy company and make a decent amount but still I live at home because I have no one to join me, friends or a girlfriend (I am straight btw). I don't consider myself attractive in any sense of the word and I have never had a real relationship (last one  was when I was 11 so I dont really count it).

Been on anti depressents since I was 18 and have pretty much not had a day in the last 10 years where I havent thought about killing myself. Yes they are clearly fuckin working wonders. My confidence is dwindling and everything I used to love doing now rarely makes me feel any sort of happiness. I own a car and still havent passed my test because I can't seem to find the time or motivation to do it, so I walk to work most places and rely on buses or taxis the rest of the time.

I ask myself more and more if there is any use in me actually existing any more since literally everything I can do could be done by someone else better than me.

I have some female friends, well coworkers really that try to encourage me by saying things like 'you've got to meet the right girl' etc. I dont think so. I think I'm just too pathetic for anyone.

I used to love film making, animation etc.particularly Monster Movies but a rotten experience with education destroyed my passion and steered me towards a 9-5 job with no creativity and a one way path to pension and death. Probably alone.

  When? When will I feel differently. Must I always chase company? Will I always run after moments of dopamine and adrenaline to avoid the massive hole of nothing inside me? 
  What fills an empty soul? What can fill me up once and for all? Not God. I've tried. Not love. I've done that too. I've love many people but all love does is cause me anxiety. Fear of abandonment. So much fear ill run away first. I always run away first. And I think I'll run forever. Run right into death's arms. I'll run until I can't go anymore.

True me Im gonna define the past of my future self. I will write the new chapter, fresh. Is it worth it? Its pricless. Guess what again, whats left after all of us? No one will remember us, no one will remember our story, not that anyone would care in the first place but... We gonna be defined by those who will come after us. They will give us new names and they will call us Gods. So I think humans are defined by the past, the Gods are defined by the future. I am gonna be defined by myself.

He has expressed that he is depressed and is feeling extra pressure that he has to work rather than having the freedom to quit.

This has frustrated me as 2022 gave us a lot of surprises, and I lost $5000 from my savings to keep us afloat.

786,My head feels like a double edged sword,1,12724ri,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12724ri/my_head_feels_like_a_double_edged_sword/,0,"I’m in a paralyzing state of panic - it induces the false narrative that I have a loaded gun to my head-

oddly it isn’t the gun I am afraid of.

A constant state of fight or flight, my head is screaming, I have something to worry about but the problem ceases to exist (everyone’s staring- do they know?), there is a fire burning but for some reason I am the only one who can see the smoke- it’s choking me- a revolving door of negative emotions and paranoia that make it hard to breathe, hard to conform thoughts and regulate emotions, everything is exploding and misfiring in my brain.

Russian roulette. Will today finally be the day?

Fear, angst, sadness, betrayal, remorse, shame- all on repeat as the disc continues to skip every few beats and give me a moment of stillness.  Being so aware that everything you know seems as though it’s a curse. Feeling everything or nothing at all. Teetering on what is my reality and what is truly happening.

I want someone to quiet the noise inside my head but I can’t let anyone too close, the unachievable. Come here but stay away. My solutions are solutions that cause more consequences to me, more pain. Do I deserve it? Do I enjoy it? Am I insane?

Happy, content, numb, sadness, anger, fear. Round and round they go as though I am flipping quickly through the pages of a book and every page I stop on leads to suicide. Anything to get away from this mess and bring silence. Anything to not feel as though I’m a puppet in everyone else’s stories- trying so hard to break free of those shackles. Confiding what I truly am inside. Is it too ugly for everyone else to see? Or is it just too ugly for me?

I can hear the words I speak. But they don’t feel like they are coming from me.
Panic -
Auto pilot -
Panic -
Auto pilot -
Explosion -
Jump

Who am I? What am I? What will I become?

Can they hear me screaming? Can they hear the muffled sounds while I gasp for air as I get plunged deeper into the water? (Figuratively speaking of course, because my physical body is not drowning- however, my soul is clawing to get out of the deep end - desperately trying to find a life raft to grab onto with not one in sight)

Someone once told me I was beautiful when I cried. As if my pain somehow resembled beauty. If only they could see what I see. But my tears were only a mere result of my obsessive overthinking and my deep self hatred and inability to understand why the world was full of so much cruelness. They were the least of my problems- for on the outside all the abuse and scars and allowing people to harm me would in turn allow me to feel the pain I needed to feel to validate what I have always believed to be true about myself - as I slowly watch the liquid seeping out of my veins and I can breathe again.

under my bed.
Because the monsters
were inside my head.

for no monsters I see.

I have severe depression and suicidal thoughts but fortunately and also unfortunately I'm good at hiding it, somehow. Until recently. CLARIFICATION: I am not a teenager looking for attention. I seriously need help because I cannot take another second being here. I don't know what to do with myself and I really feel no point in being alive anymore.. my principles and teachers are somewhat vaguely aware I have problems, but ig sometimes the people who don't show it so much have it the worst. I'm gonna try not to sound self-centered, because I know other people have problems. I just need someone/ some people who really know how I feel and want to help, rather than just call me a little bitch because I can't handle my own fucking mind. I feel like I'm going insane and slowing losing consciousness of it too. I need help. I feel so worthless no matter how hard try. I feel like there is no point in anything anymore and I just want peace. I'm forcing myself to eat right now and I don't like it. I am hungry, because humans get hungry, but like I just didn't want to eat, but I told myself things like not eating leads to eating disorders and cutting myself. I don't wanna be there. I wanna feel something, but I don't wanna resort to self-harm. Anyway my principal is essentially trying to convince me not to end it and she tells me that I'm smart and a good role model because I come to school everyday and listen to the teachers. As if it's optional. They all thought I was going to blow the place up at the start of the year, so I'm on my last straw with admins. Also, I have to say it, I smoke weed rather excessively. On the bus to school. I'm an idiot for it, and I keep doing it because if I'm gonna live everyday like it's my last, I'm gonna smoke like it's my last. I'm scared everyday I'm going to get caught, and I simultaneously do not care. What? Anyway I.. I just don't see anything to live for, but I feel like I have everything too. But as everyone knows.. money can't buy happiness. I seem to be feeling that. I seen my dad after about three years. In a Walmart parking lot. We talked for like an hour and a half and I had I total breakdown right there. I could barely walk. It was the best and worst moment of my life. I just wanted it to last forever. My dad seems to be the only person who can even somewhat relate to me like this, and he's also my only parent that knows I smoke. I know he worries about me, and vice versa. Uh. I just realized this might not sound all that bad. To clarify again, this is all what goes through my mind at once, on constant cycles. I just feel so overwhelmed all the time and I see no point in any of it. I don't think anything is worth doing anymore and I just don't wanna exist at this point. But people who kill themselves are viewed as cowards or bitches who just ended it because they were a little stressed out. I just want to feel meaning, some worth, some kind of reason to live. I need help before this gets to bad.

When I do try to tell people in person why I'm sad or how I feel I just end up saying random things that don't make sense, because I can't find the right words.

Usually when I get asked why I look upset is when I'm zoning out. when I'm zoning out I look like I'm depressed, probably because I think of the most depressing stuff when zoning out. Sometimes when I zone out I think about what would happen if I just died, like right now, would anyone care? Or would they just forget about me.

I am broke, deeply in debt and despite being told I am smart I am a failure with a low paying job and no ability to go back to school. Even if I could go back to school I was always a poor student for a few different reasons. I have anxiety and low self esteem. If I could I would ask my parents why they did this to me. Why did they bring me into this world. If I was sure I wouldn’t go to hell for it I would’ve killed myself already, years ago probably. While I don’t want to hurt the people who care about me there’s a gnawing sensation that they would be fine if not better off without me. If nothing else they’d get over it because their minds aren’t malfunctioning like mine. The possibility of another 30-40 more years alive on this planet are irritating and horrifying.

796,Girls Always Lead Me On,1,1270r7p,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1270r7p/girls_always_lead_me_on/,1,"This has happened to me so many times. I understand that sometimes friendliness can be mistaken for flirtation, but there’s no way all these girls didn’t know what they were doing. In fact, I think the majority of them either knew and didn’t care or did it because they liked the attention and were flattered without thinking about how it would affect a guy who genuinely likes them. I feel like I have a pretty good read on women and if they’re flirting or not but I get it’s impossible to know for sure. But there’s definitely girls that have led me on and just played games with me. I start flirting with them and they don’t actually like me back and want to date me. But they flirt back anyway. I consider myself a pretty attractive guy (genuinely not trying to boast, I just think that’s part of it) and it’s an ego boost for a girl to think I like them. It’s like they love the attention, so they lean into the flirting even though they don’t want anything to happen. One time I had a girl who was super quiet at first, then after months started flirting heavily back with me and in the end she didn’t even want to hangout with me. Not didn’t want to date me, straight up didn’t even want to hangout at all. And she wasn’t even nice about it, she straight up just said no, didn’t even try to sugar coat it with an excuse like “oh I’m pretty busy lately” to be polite. Like gee thanks. I would talk to her all day everyday and we’d flirt a lot. Even if I misinterpreted niceness as flirting, she doesn’t even want to be friends? Like why do I even bother trying then?

The other thing that sucks is I’m a trans guy. I feel like I read women better than the average man cause you know, I was a girl at on point. So I feel even more so that a lot of these girls were just playing me on.  It also sucks because sometimes I feel like if some girls knew I was trans they’d see me as less threatening. As much as I’d like to be seen as any other man I get women have to be aware to stay safe. And I also get what they go through, I’m a female too. I don’t know. Dating is so hard as a trans man who likes women. 

I have to accept I’m not what I want to be, but what I want to be is threatening to women. I have to deal with them potentially being hesitant to hangout with me even though I can’t threaten them the way they think I can. And at the end of the day, even if they’re more comfortable around me because I’m trans, I don’t know if they’ll still like me. To be honest, I’d say the majority of straight girls date trans guys. At least in my age range (20-25). But there’s so many obstacles to even get to that point. How am I supposed to find love?  
Again, I get I could be wrong with a few cases. But I try to be really conscious if I think a girl is trying to flirt or likes me to not make it seem like I’m reciprocating if I don’t feel that way because I get it really sucks. But some people seem to not even try or just don’t care. As long as they get attention who cares if they play with my feelings? 

I also want to make it clear I’m not trying to hate on women. I’m sure men do this or similar things too, I just wouldn’t know because I don’t pursue them so. 


TLDR Girls seem to lead me on all the time and I always get hurt. Could’ve possibly misinterpreted niceness for flirting in a few cases, but it’s happened too many times to count. Some people just will play with your emotions to make themselves feel good and wanted.",1680213848.0

Lately, I have been thinking about earning some extra money on the side by stripping or sugar dating. I'm not familiar with either really, however I like the thought of ""being"" someone else occasionally and mostly getting spoiled. I know, that it might not be a glamorous life style, it's different and will give some variation to my every day routines. - I don't mean to work as a exotic dancer or sugar babe every day nor weekend. I want to explore that world on some weekends and even holidays. Perhaps the whole fantasy about someone taking care of me for a night all inclusive, is extra exciting to me, since I have a lot of responsibilities as a young adult and not quite a lot of zeros in the bank. ~ Please note, that if I choose to try these things out, I will inform my boyfriend and have a serious talk with him about the topic.

I still live at the same place and study the same topic at the University. - In that sense life hasn't changed much.

My grandpa got the tumor removed, and is currently doing well. 

I got a boyfriend, whom treats me so much better from my last boyfriend. He studies as well, just another topic. We see each other often, meaning once a week, which fits us both, since we need time to study, work and nourish our own interests. Of course I miss him, however I'm satisfied on the most days with the way we do things. The only issue is, that he's leaving in August to study in US 1/2 year. I don't have the means to visit him, but I will give him some handwritten letters, that he can open on special occasions throughout his stay.",1680200124.0

As each day went by and the more we talked the more intoxicated I got with her love. Soon we went on a trip and I made her my girl and from then on life seemed to be as amazing as i could’ve ever asked for. She had this brightness in her that made me feel complete like if she was around nothing could stop me. The problems came and it still had no effect on the amount of love I felt for her. She was my world and I did anything to take care of her. She soon moved in after graduation and I started working out in the fields. Worked long hours with the soul purpose of providing for her I always told her I’d take care of her no matter what and that she’d never have to work. Months went by and problems grew this time things got rough and we ended up in a new chapter of our lives where we lost it all and had to start from scratch. I then couldn’t keep my promise she had to work cause I couldn’t make enough money and I was stressed beyond believe that I wasn’t as great a person as I once was. That stress grew when I lost my job and she had to take care of me. I drove her away and hurt her when I started to shut down. I never knew why men said not to cry in front of your wife but I soon learned that showing her that weakness only drove her away. If I only knew what I know now I would do it all over again but this time enjoy every minute of my life next to her.

Since I was roughly 15 i’ve been fascinated with life after death, so much in fact i attempted too take my own life by overdose. I obviously failed but that launched my counseling journey. More recently (last june-october) i had been seeing a state appointed psychiatrist and didn’t make any progress. I would lie to him too make me seem normal or that I wasn’t “depressed.” In october the office dropped me as a patient with no reason givin and never returned my calls. I’ve never been medicated even (90% sure i’m marked as drug seeking in the system) though i’ve sought SSRI’s, any form of anti anxiety meds, etc. I’m not sad about my position, im indifferent. These thoughts of killing myself so I can explore the possibilities of expanded consciousness gets overwhelming. I’ll go weeks at a time of de-realization and borderline psychosis and then suddenly *snap* into myself again. My thoughts are so scattered it seems impossible too form coherent pieces of information. I don’t do mind altering substances anymore, smoke weed when I get home from work and go to bed, but this everlasting longing for the quantum void is causing me to give suicidal ideation too much power. 40% of my days are spent thinking about ways I can painlessly kill myself, my favorite so far being the suicide bag. Read about that in a Stephen king book in high school and years later, i can’t get that thought out of my head.

TL;DR I’ve had depression for 4 years, gotten antidepressants, and multiple types of therapy this entire time. I have two stages: livrable depression and sever/suicidal depression. Treatment only ever steers me from being suicidal, I never don’t have depression.

I’ve been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder since 2019 and have had no shift in my diagnosis since then. That’s FOUR years of therapy, anti-represents, doctors/specialists etc. Yet no improvement. 

I’ve started to see my life in either two phases: suicidal or non-suicidal. That’s how I categorize my mental well-being. 

Even when I’m non-suicidal I’m still depressed. For example, showering happens at most once a week at this time (to maybe once every two weeks), because my partner/family forces me. I have to set a timer to remind me to force myself to eat a meal. Same for water. Same for bathroom. I need to have someone wake me up and make sure I leave my room, or I won’t, and my homework only gets done because I have to schedule study sessions with friends so they force me to do work. Activities I also need to force myself to do and have everything scheduled. I don’t actually find most things fun(things I used to love before depression). I make myself read or watch things but I never feel the want to. If I do feel like doing fun things it’s a rare “content” day or week for me. I’m unable to keep up with people so I don’t have a ton of friends. Even during this time I usually feel hopeless, disinterested, numb. So friends are hard because I need to pretend. My ideal would be lying in bed and doing nothing, but I want friends and to experience things so I drag myself out everyday. 

Usually people can’t tell I’m depressed during this time since I’m able to dress well, wear deodorant, brush my teeth, wash my face. 

Then there are my bad fazes. These can range from really depressed to suicidal. Can’t leave bed, can’t do homework, can’t see anyone, eating’s impossible, I have to physically drag myself to do things. Everything’s painful. I want to just lay down and not move again. Then of course that can lead to suicidal ness. I won’t get into that, you all probably understand. 

I’m not sure what to do to help? I’ve had 3 therapists, gone on 6 different antidepressants, received suicide treatment, etc. Any tips would be so helpful! I really want to get better and be just a little content, just some of the time.

He sometimes showed up at my work place (I am at retail so anybody can stop by), and ask about my mental health in front of my coworkers… which I don’t want my coworkers to know.

My mother said that if she knew he had depression, she wouldn’t have married him (they got married after a short romance and divorced when I was 12 after a family tragedy). 

I am not really sure if my depression is due to genetics or trauma, because my childhood was pretty fucked up (as was his).

849,I’m losing the battle.,3,126kh35,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/126kh35/im_losing_the_battle/,4,"
This is an open cry for help, depression have taken over me.

Is so bad that I have a disturbed sense of reality, I cannot see myself being happy no matter what I do nor what I achieve.

I’m 21 and about 3-4 years ago everything in my life was running smoothly. 

I started to pursue my passion as a filmmaker and started doing a bunch of music videos and other cool projects while I was in high school. 

I also had good friends, had a girlfriend and was in good shape.

Once I finished high school I had the opportunity to travel for a few months to a foreign country to practice my English.

There I had the time of my life, met cool ppl, took awesome pics, visited cool places and I even make a film project there and turned out excellent.

After that, I got the opportunity to go to college in that country but in another city

I didn’t study what I wanted (filmmaking), I ended up studying marketing bc I started to learning it by my own to market my own filmmaking biz and it seemed fun.

At that time, I was all-in in the entrepreneurial mindset. I got my mind washed by internet gurus and thought that I needed to make lots of money by a young age so I put an unrealistic pressure on myself. 


I also got contacted by a friend (the same age as me) who asked me if I wanted to start a marketing agency with him.


I accepted the offer, and because I was a very competitive person and I have this urge to “succeed”, I started learning all I could about marketing.

I lied myself telling me that’ll manage to run the marketing agency while running my filmmaking biz

But that was not the case. I got “addicted”to consume all kind of online marketing (mkt) courses from all kind of mkt gurus as I realized that my college was trash and I’ll not learn anything useful. 

I easily spent about 3-4k worth of courses, book, coaches, etc

I literally spent all the money that I was making in my shitty part time job in mkt courses - thinking that I needed all that info to succeed with my mkt agency 

But y’all already know how this went. After a year trying to make it, my friend and I only got bad clients, lots of rejection, humiliations and we only made like 300 bucks. 

And I lost precious time, I literally spent the whole day in the pc studying. Add that , my college classes where online so I barely leave the house. 


I gained LOTS of weight (+30kg) and my social skills decreased a lot too.

Noted that all this happened when moving to a new city, so I didn’t invest time to meet new people & make friends.

After that, I spend all Day (and money) playing video games, masturbating, arguing with strangers on internet and posting memes on fb groups.

I’m even more fat, have no social skills at all - I now can’t stand people, stopped watching movies, stopped learning about directing and now I have so much hate inside ( towards life and my choices, not others) 

I also developed a food addiction, a social media addiction, and a “no leaving my house” addiction. 

All of this is making me feel lonely & depressed. 

To the point that I could  not talk with anyone in DAYS. 

And let’s don’t even talk about women, I see myself in the mirror and I feel like no one would want a guy like me. 

So right now I’m not even trying. If I match with a girl in tinder, I’d ghost her by auto sabotaging myself, saying that is not worth it bc she will ghost me once we meet in person and see how ugly I am and how socially awkward I am.

I know this is fucked up, I think that the fact that I left my dream aside for a project and failed, hit me extremely hard.

I feel like a failure, I feel like a bad son, bad brother & bad human being.

Rn I don’t have the will to do anything, I finish college in a few months and the idea of working just terrifies me.

My biggest fear is working in cubicle for 8 hours in a company for the rest of my life. And rn it seems the only option I have.


All this has led me to fantasize about killing myself every night, and if I’m being completely honest, the only reason I’m not dead is because I cannot purchase a gun and I’m too scare of doing it in other ways as it’ll be too painful.


I know I need profesional help, and last week I payed for a therapy session and I left completely disappointed.

The session was like 20 minute long and I couldn’t tell her everything that’s happening to me. 

Then she asked me to pay for some expensive test and suggested me to pay for two completely treatments at the same time (neuro rehabilitation and therapy) I felt that all she wanted his my money. 

So while I give therapy another try with another therapist,  I’d like you guys to give me some advice and how to deal and overcome this situation ❤️‍🩹

Then why does it stay consistent even if I want to do more in life, but I simply don't have the energy?

Even if feel better and I'm willing to do things, I just can't, just getting out of bed requires a lot of energy, even if I desperately want to have more energy.

And this is why I probably will never achieve much in life, unless there's a miracle cure.

And antidepressants make it worse not better, so it can't be just mental.

 I ding take it anymore obviously.

Things I can't do: exercising without feeling extremely tired even after light exercise.

Also I don't get stronger.

I cannot work, I cannot take much care of myself.

Sometimes I can't even get out of bed.

I can't do most hobbies, nowadays even gaming is often too much due to brain fog and chronic tiredness.

It's one of the best schools in my country (it's a small country so in a European standpoint, it may not be as good). Me and my best buddy decided that we want to apply, without the influence of our parents (although they were very supportive of our choice). We both got accepted but were put in different classes (despite us mentiong the friendship we had). Then things started to... happen at start of the new semester. I developed insomnia, which led to my performance to drastically decrease. I couldn't do what I was capable of back home, and I lost the confidence I had with my favourite subjects. This made me anxious about tests and grades, which ironically kept my insomnia alive. Everyday I was frightened of going to bed, and what would happen if I lost sleep again. I hated the school that made my life a nightmare and destroyed my ambitions and goals. The only things that kept me going were my friends and the teachers, whom I adored dearly. It took me two years, but I finally (semi-)beat insomnia. I usually sleep around 6-7 hours which is a step up for me. But I can't get out of the chaotic lifestyle that I had living with sleep deprivation: I stay up late scrolling through my phone, do meaningless things in my free time, be late everywhere, not achieve my goals regarding my grades and have a messy personal space. I'm eager to change, but something always draws me back to my old self-destructing habits. This makes the thought of leaving the place behind resurface, but than I always convince myself that I have close relationships here and also the education is fantastic. At the start of my 3rd year we wrote a test, which reaported the math groups (we are in math groups based on the result of this and previously I was in the best group) I panicked and got kicked down to a worse one, with one of the most unsympatic evil bastard being the teacher. Alongside my hopes of working within a field related to mathematics the image I had of my social life shattered, when it was time for choosing roommates (students from 11th grade and upwards get to do that). No one chose to be with me! Okay, I said to myself: I wasn't initiative enough. I asked around cautiously and came to the conclusion based on my classmates responses that I was right. But today was the second time this has happened! Should I really believe that it was once again just me, not asking people to live together (you could say again that I wasn't ""initiative enough"" 'cuz I was sick and out for 3 days)?

I finished uni and relapsed severely. My biggest block is I don't know what I want, rather, I can't decide on what I want to do with my life

Long version - I've always lived with depression. Medicated, see a psychologist etc etc whatever. I'm in my late 20s and constantly feeling like I'm getting too old to start anything (which is perpetuated by society and the media to a large degree). Since I graduated Uni I have completely relapsed into severe depression and tried different meds for 18 months. I haven't touched art since. I had a gap year - Didn't work a job. Indulged in whatever made me happy. Vegetated. Slept. 

I went on a trip interstate recently and I was happy. I came back, miserable again. I thought the trip gave me some direction of what I wanted to do ie. Move away from home and live in a better city with an actual lgbt scene. Do odd work to survive while I take acting classes to see if I have any talent. Maybe buy a horse if I can even afford that. Have a place in the lgbt community. 

My problem is I seem to switch interests/wants so often that I never know what I want. 

+I want to train horses and get to 5* level (then my brain says all the reasons I can't do that, too short, will destroy my body, no money). 

+No, actually I want to be an actor and be *someone* (then my brain again tries to tell me why I'm not good enough to do that). 

+No wait, I want to live in another country and figure out my shit there (again.. My brain chimes in with its negativity). 

This is what my brain does to me all the time. I can't settle on a path because my stupid thoughts flick like a light switch. On one thing off to the next thing. I don't know if I have adhd. I can't afford to get a psychiatrist to deal with this dumb shit that goes on in my head. 

My psychologist seems to think my mind changes a lot because I don't have a purpose or goals. I feel like this isn't helping me address what's going on. Something clearly isn't right when I have such unfocused thoughts. I hop from 'interest flavour of the day/week/month' constantly, and I can never make a decision because I'm scared it's just temporary and my career ideas will change again.

My friends are all slowly doing their own thing, I feel like my friend group has went from 5 close friends to only 1 friend that I’ve remained close with, and even then our schedules conflict so much to the point that we rarely see each other.

I spend most days rarely speaking. My parents hate each other and are constantly stressed about something, and even though the car crash wasn’t my fault I still feel like I’m the main reason for that stress. Like if I never had my car in the first place my parents wouldn’t be worrying constantly. It’s odd because it feels like I don’t truly love them, but I guess I do? It’s not like I hate them or anything but I hold a resentment towards them because I had to grow up with 2 people who were constantly looking for reasons to argue with each other. It even spilled over to my relationships where I just felt weird introducing them to my girlfriend because I didn’t want her to see that my parents were unhappy, especially compared to hers. Either way, they tried their best raising me so I owe them. 

Besides that I’ve felt like a failure. I used to have really high grades throughout my school years and I felt like I was always supposed to be doing something bigger than I am at the moment. Instead I’m just a subpar student who is more of a financial burden than anything.

Besides that I’ve also lost my passion for my main hobby which is skateboarding. I don’t progress in skating anymore and I’m too anxious to even go out and do it anymore. I’m not worried about other people when I skate, but now I’m afraid of driving and even when I am skating I’m always in my own head about not being able to land a certain trick that I’ve always used to be able to do. During the past few days there’s been times where I’ve wanted to go out and skate my I psyched myself out of doing so because I was afraid of driving/worried that I’d just end up hating myself even more after.

I have no ambition either. I don’t have a true passion for my major and I just keep trying because I feel like I have to repay my parents for what they’ve put in for me.

I’ve been on break from school for the past few days and being too afraid to drive anywhere/not having anything to do has been rough. I’ve been stuck having to hear my own thoughts constantly. I tried to block them out by trying to get something done, and I ended up cleaning my whole house for hours which kept me busy but once I was done all my thoughts came rushing back into my head. The one time I saw my friend over spring break was fun but as soon as I got home I just felt sad again.

All of this is just added on top of other things. I didn’t get into my first choice college and opted to go to community college and transfer rather than just go to my second choice college, which honestly has felt like a big mistake. It sucks seeing most of my friends going out and doing things and life while I’m stuck at home basically just doing nothing but school (which I’m not the best at) and work. My first year of college has been so bad compared to my senior year of high school. During my senior year I had a good relationship, and I spent the whole year cruising through my classes with good grades. This led to my friends and I always having time to go out and do random stuff. Like certain days we’d just have nothing to do so we’d randomly organize a beach trip or something but now we obviously can’t do that. Now everyday feels like a constant loop of the school and work just made worse with stress and anxiety and self-doubt.

I truly don’t know if what I’m going through is depression or just a rough patch but it sucks. It hurts me to know that so many people are going through so much worse things in life. It makes me feel even worse for not being able to properly deal with this stuff while so many people are able to push through the most horrible of circumstances.

I just hope to find joy in life again",1680191693.0

I moved out of my abusive mother’s home about a year ago. I lost a lot, but at least I was out of there. Then I lost my health insurance, my mom got me kicked off. I was never taught anything for survival on my own, so its taken me almost a year to start to figure things out and get new health insurance. So I ended up going off some meds cause I had to put my money towards my disability, epilepsy. So no metal meds for about half a year. 

Then very recently I had a bad breakup which left me feeling even more like shit. And I lost all my friends because they were friends with my ex first. Even the one I thought would still be friends with me just stopped talking to me. I have my Dad and Stepmom, who took me in after what happened with my mom, but I only just met them two years prior so I’m still getting to know them despite living with them now. And while they’ve been so sweet and caring, I feel like nothing but a huge burden to them. 

I’ve tried to go out and meet other people, but it leads to nothing. I’m going to college online but lately all I can think is whats the point? Careers are dead, especially graphic design that I’ve been majoring in (4 years now so little too late to change it). I barely eat, I cry everyday. I have almost no one. I go to work, come home and do what college work I can then maybe uselessly try to scroll through social media or play video games before I just cry myself to sleep. I feel like something is wrong with me and I don’t know how to fix it. I don’t know how to be happy and fix my life or meet people.

Lot of words to say I’m depressed cause life has sucked for me and I don’t know how to fix it or be happy. I don’t remember how to find happiness in things or make connections with people anymore. The mental meds never fully helped before, but maybe thats because i was still with my mother when taking them. I can only hope they’ll help when i start them again, but i feel like i should be doing more. But I don’t know what.

Update: Things got worse because of my ex. He’s having some sort of manic god complex episode and is doing terrible things. Out of safety for me and someone else I’m not going into detail for now, anonymous or not. But yeah. And also now my grandpa is dying. So life really fucking sucks.

I wake up thinking about my past and I spend the day in my bed or if not that I’m out with my only friend smoking weed. I’m very emotional and I hate to admit that, In real life I would seem anything but, I put off a no emotion persona but it’s not true. I go home to nothing and I goto bed depressed almost every night grieving the past and am always thinking about past relationships. I live in a loop, a constant cycle of just doing the same thing

I forgot to say I’m also on anti depressants but only have been for 6 months. 

Something which does motivate me is history. I don’t have much but I watch so much about history and documentary’s and it’s become something I really have a passion for. I watch things about people living with tribes or living with people who are disconnected from society. I feel like I need to be away from my phone and from everything around me so I can really realise how small I am in this big beautiful world. The worst thing is I’m self aware of all the self destructive stuff I am doing to myself and I think it hurts me even more.

I did what others were doing around me not knowing what I actually like. and this is where all went wrong. my graduation degree is very basic and I do hold diploma in graphic design but I don't want to work in it. I just purely hate it. My mind just doesn't work. I just start getting panic attacks and sweating when I even think about it.

I looking for normal govt. clerical job. Being gay I don't think I will ever get a partner in my country. Had one distant relationship but even that also my luck ran out. Just 30k-35k INR salaried govt. job will be enough for me. I have worked on such job, but boss was too toxic and pay was also very low. Only govt. jobs offer respectable job for such post.

Everytime I am happy, I always remind myself that it's not going to lasts. I've been depressed since age 11, grew up being bullied constantly by all types of kids since age 5. I'm going to be honests, I wasnt a normal kid. I was weird, a crybaby, and dramatic. Other kids found me annoying and made fun of me or simply kept their distance away from me. I always had trouble making friends.

I never had peace in my life. I had to drop out of high school because I got cyber bullied for getting groomed by a teacher. I didnt grow up with my father by my side, so I easily fell in love with a male teacher. I have terrible daddy issues. I'm currently working towards a GED, but with my depression weighing me down, it's difficult. I'm supposed to go to my alternative school (for my GED) in the morning, but I feel like I should give up.

A middle age man in his 30s took my virginity the summer before sophomore year. I was desperate for male validation and love from an older man since I was robbed of that since childhood. I'm not a pick me, dont get it twisted. I'm a girls girl. I would never step over another woman for a man. I know me talking about male validation make me sound like one, but dont worry. Not to mention, the same year I was r@ped at age 15 while being intoxicated. It was my first time drinking, the little brother's hosts of the party walked me home and raped me in my bedroom. And yes, he went to my old highschool. The investigation is stil ongoing.

Everytime I try to off myself I get scared about the afterlife, if there is even one. I'm scared on what awaits me on the other side. I'm not the most innocent person, so I'm scared I'll bare a harsh punishment. I'm an athiests but I still question life.

I'm bipolar, I have terrible mood swings, I'm either hyper or very lazy. I'm either happy or depressed/angry. Lot's of my negative traits i've adopted from my abusive mother, who still till this day denies that she's the reason I'm this way. She believes it's my years of bullying, but she has also contributed in a fat chunk of my suffering. Ever since age 6, my mother been abusing me physically & mentally. Later on my older sisters followed her lead. I've been abused physically by everyone whos older than me.

I'm currently saving up money to move out of this hell hold. I currently have 3.2K saved with $100 coming soon. I will have 3.3k saved by the end of today (March 30th). I want to raise atleasts 6k since I still have over a year before I become a legal adult. But I honestly dont know if I'll make it to that goal. My depression been kicking my ass.

I've developed body image issues, I've scrolled through ED twitter a few times. I want to work out to become 110 lbs atleasts. Last time I checked I'm 120 and 4'11 (149.86 cm). I want to be skinnier so I can be more desired by older successful men. My dream is bizzare, it's to marry a wealthy ""comfortable"" man. I want to be a trophy wife.  I've been suffering all my life that I want my happy ending. I feel like I deserve it and sometimes I feel like I dont. I want to have a better happy ending then all the people I went to school with who judged and harassed me. I want to stick it to them! I want my revenge, their karma. I'm a strong believer in revenge.

I sometimes think about the possibilities of me never getting a happy ever after, it makes me wanna off myself before I waste the rest of my life wishing and hoping. If I cant get my happily ever after then theres no point in living. I know this sounds bratty, but it's how I feel. I just feel robbed of everything, security, proper housing, money, friends, childhood, healthy family, etc. That now I want all of those and more. If you read through this then thankyou.

I was six-years-old and eating a McDonald’s 101 Dalmatians Happy Meal when I told both my parents I wanted to go to sleep and never wake up. I am turning 33 next week and desperately depressed. I have Bipolar Disorder and have attempted suicide so many times I lost count. Things have been especially shitty the last almost two years when the love of my life left me and I had to move in back with my mom. Things are somewhat looking up now as I am going on a trip to South Korea with a stop in Seattle on the way back (lifelong Nirvana fan) and I’ve made some big accomplishments at work. 

But I still constantly want to die. I start rehearsing my suicide note in my head and picture how I’d commit. Most nights I dream of jumping off something high. I’m just a generally morbid person. I love Tim Burton, The Walking Dead, Nirvana and collect all kinds of macabre things like animal bones and oddities. 


Nothing puts me at ease like the thought of not having to live through another day. But I have a tremendous amount of guilt at the idea of leaving everyone behind. I feel like it’s not fair to make them go through that even though it would be best for me.


I have gone through so much trauma in my life from being raped, to being abused in every way by my father and now losing the person who meant most to me. I feel like I can go through this shit anymore. 

I am such a people pleaser and I think that’s the part of me that wants to stay. The part that says “think of your mom” or “how will your sibling deal with it”.

i've never been formally diagnosed, but i've always felt like i've had struggles when it comes to trying to keep myself happy, or at least just alive.

recently, the thoughts of taking my own life have become less loud in my head, but now, they're being replaced by constant episodes of staring blankly and just dissociating. i can only get out of that state when something disruptive happens like someone walking in, or something drops and snaps me out of that silence. i would immediately start to feel very panicky and have trouble breathing for a short while before i get my crap together and everything goes back to normal.

it's really just a vicious cycle.

i've only decided to reach out anonymously for help because it's started to take a tremendous toll on my productivity at work (i'm only interning though, a new semester is about to start.), and my physical health. my biggest worry is that when the suicidal thoughts come back on top of these 'stuck in a daze' slump episodes, i'll truly do something stupid to hurt myself and the people around me.

i absolutely love writing or doing things that are creative and involve words, but with this recent thing happening to me, it's been so hard to just *do* things.

The constant feeling of deep sadness that grips your body is a state I’m all too familiar with. 
I always, for the longest time, attributed this feeling of melancholy to having the wrong attitude in life - maybe it’s because I’m too ambitious and as a result I’m never settled leading to depression, maybe it’s because I’m bullied etc. 

For all intents and purposes, I have a good life - decent job that pays the bills, decent family & friends etc. But the melancholy has been my constant companion. 

I’ve since, over the last year made a lot of healthy changes to my life to better cope with this - quit smoking completely, go to the gym every 2 days, cold showers every morning, and most importantly, have started to practice meditation. 

The feeling of melancholy, while I’m able to now react to it better, does not go away. 

Where I think it feels like now I’m more confident in the fact that it’s a chemical issue is during meditation when I have no fixed or obsessive thoughts - I still feel the heaviness of sadness deep in my chest. Even when I’m able to observe my thoughts and know there’s no negative thoughts I feel the heavy sadness in my chest. Is this a way to know what I have is actually chemical?

It's weird because with that I've already made a lot of new friends and sometimes when I'm with them I feel really good, but most of the time it's the same apathy and emptiness as usual.

I've been doing this for as long as I've been doing it naturally, so I act the same way with my psychologist and my psychiatrist, so they think I'm getting better and are even decreasing my meds, and for some time reason it makes me feel relieved.

Today I feel a huge sense of guilt for this, since I'm approaching new people and getting closer to those I already knew, so if I end up doing something stupid I'm afraid of affecting them.

Even romantically I ended up relating, but I didn't fall in love, the other person fell in love and I was that empty shell not knowing how to react.

I think I'm screwing up my friendships because people are falling in love with me and I don't know why. In less than 2 months, 3 people declared themselves to me and ended up walking away when I said I didn't have the same feelings.

On July 16 my family is moving to Scotland, my parents have always wanted to and I suppose now's their chance.

This means that I am coming with, and losing everything I have built up, all I will have is myself and my possessions.

I have the option of moving back, my friends have made it clear that they would be willing to move in together for not-going-bankrupt-due-to-rent purposes.

But to be honest, I don't know if I will.

My past has been eating away at me as of late, as I come to realize I have nothing.

I currently hang out with 5 others, we're a group of 6.

And I honestly don't believe I'm needed by them.

I am a very dull and pathetic person, and I am not at all enjoyable to be around.

I've noticed more and more how I just sink away into the background when we're together, I could leave and I doubt anyone would notice.

I'll call her John

I have always cared about people, so when others are at their lowest I often help them get back up.

That period is where I find a true friend.

Once they get better, or  find someone else however, it's over.

My best friend of 2 years got a boyfriend, and that was that

It's a crushing cycle

I remember John said to me that she would stick around, and that we would get better together.

I bore people. because I have nothing to offer

I also have nothing outside of people

For the last 3 years I've wanted to make something

I spend the majority of my time consuming media and analyzing

I love how powerful art is

I've always wanted to be a game dev, I know a very dull dream

For the last 3 years, though, as much as I wanted to, I've never had the motivation

I can't find it in me to work on anything

I have no motivation

I just coast

I have no reason to live beyond fearing death

I have accomplished nothing. and will soon be thrust into a world of unknowns, anxiety, and regret

This post was supposed to be my declaration that I'd start learning Blender

I was planning it at work, I was going to scream my passion to the world and start something

I have up before my shift even ended

I want to be loved

I want to have purpose

Yet with how little value I have, it's unattainable",1680147617.0

I just stare at the screen and I feel like they think I’m ignoring them. I just want to stay in my room and never speak to anyone again. I want to get help it at the same time the sadness is where I feel the most comfort. I need to cry but I feel like I can’t and when I do it’s usually not a whole lot. I just want to have something really bad happen to me so maybe then people might start caring and worrying about me more even though when they ask I always say I’m fine.

This is the longest spree I've had without going into a psych facility.  Since 2012, I've been hospitalized 15 times for suicide attempts, ideation, severe SH, you name it.  It actually got to the point that the last three times I was hospitalized, when I arrived, the nurses and some techs remembered me!  I didn't remember them.  I have a hard time remembering what people look like. 

This time of year is usually when I'm coming out of depressions, if anything.  But this year, I suppose we're doing things differently.  After some passive SH thoughts, I really don't know...  It's like the weight of the world is on my mind and then I fell in a black hole.  It was bad when I woke up, but it kept getting worse and worse throughout the day.  Usually, mornings are when I feel my worst...

After crying so hard I made no sound for about 30 minutes, I told my Mom.  She had just gotten off work and my Dad was on the phone.  She called back when he was able to talk.  They were ready and willing to drive out here to take me to the hospital (I'm a hospital patient PRO--I know when immediate help is needed, but this is more of a slow burn type of thing).  They reminded me that I have my ACT team and their emergency number, which was a 24 hour crisis line and would send someone from their office.  I have never used the crisis line because I don't want to end up in the hospital for a year straight again like last time!  But I feel very different than I did last time, or the other 14 times.  Yeah, I'm bitter at myself for that, which doesn't help.

I'm stuck with mental illness for life.  There's nothing I can do about it.  I'm trying to learn my way around it, especially the depression.  In the past, anxiety was the one really rearing it's ugly head more than the depression.  I have finally almost figured out a few ways to cope with that.  I had 12 panic attacks yesterday, which I know is doing nothing to help boost my mood currently.  This has been the depression monster sneaking up on me.  All of a sudden, one day, it's there.  Boo!  And I was rocking it.  Not even drinking and this happened!  Man, I won't ask what the point is.  It just is what it is.  Felt like it was relevant.

But, It just inevitably sooner or later happens again, and again, and again, and then I start hating myself, wanting to hurt or envision killing myself, etc. It's such a shitty feeling and I don't get it. I know irritability is a symptom of depression, but I have never met someone who seems to react the way I react to things, at least not nearly as strongly. I just feel so weak and hateful towards myself whenever I get upset like this. It really makes me want to disappear, And it makes me feel like a horrible, bad person and friend. Just having to constantly distance myself from friends to keep from lashing out or ruining friendships. I really want to change and I just started therapy last week but It's so hard to imagine myself not being this sensitive towards everything. I just have so much anger in me man, and I have to bottle it up so I don't hurt others. :(",1680127961.0

This video is just kind of silly. It's one of my favorite video game characters dancing to some music. It's nice, and I keep going back to it. But, I felt... off. Why did I keep going back to it? I mean, yeah, it's my favorite character, and it's well animated, but... them I realized something. During the dance at a couple points the camera changes, and the character looks at the camera. Best way I can describe it is kind of a look that says ""I want you.""

Once I realized that, I had to start holding back tears. It's so stupid, of course it's a character that isn't real... but it made me realize that never in my life will I have anyone look at me like that. 

I'm too much of an anxious wreck to talk to anyone, and even if I could, I'm asexual and sex repulsed, which is a huge deal breaker for so many people... 

I've already been so lonely lately, and so it just hit me so hard just how alone I feel. I'm coming up on 30 and work a shit job, and ""dated"" 1 person and it was barely dating.

I had written my life's story, but decided to delete it and do the short version.  Please ask for any elaborations-

As mentioned, It feels like I'm unhappy in every aspect of my life.  I don't like my job, but can't afford to retrain.  I make too much for assistance, but not enough to pay out of pocket. (in US)  I am against taking loans, as I have debt that I'm trying to pay down.  I do exercise and eat ok.  it could be better, but it's far from entirely junk food.  My job keeps me physically active.

Socially, It is really difficult for me to trust anyone.  I have one or two shallow friendships that I've had for decades, and a have a few more acquaintances.  Trust has always been an issue for me, but has been compounded by a LTR partner who has broken my trust several times in the last few years.  I am still with them out of necessity.  I've forgiven them, but I can't seem to forget and move past.  (Forgiving seems to be easy,  but not forgetting... not so much.  I have a keen emotional memory.  I may forgive, but I can feel the hurt in all its intensity if I ever think about whatever hurt me.)

I do not have kids and I am estranged from what is left of my small family.

I've always dealt with depression, but lately it's been much worse.  I do not remember the last time I was excited, optimistic or even happy.  I feel like all the things that I used to enjoy are now just being done out of habit.  I spend my days daydreaming about just leaving my life and moving someplace else, only to realize that I'd still be the same miserable bitch.  I've tried therapy, but... trust issues.  I do take antidepressants, but have a bad history with changing or adding, so I would rather not 'make more waves in my pond'.  The only times I seem to feel anything is from watching emotionally happy videos on Youtube.

I apologize if this is all over the place, as writing was never my strength.  I guess I'm just hoping for that one magic piece of advice on that will help me make sense of it all.  If it doesn't exist, I appreciate being given the chance to vent.",1680132297.0

I was never super popular in high school or anything but I had friends, played sports, and was socially active despite being very introverted. Fast forward three years andI am now almost done with college, about to graduate in one year, and my life has just progressively gotten worse every year since senior year of high school. 

I have not made a single friend since high school. I spend every day doing homework or working on projects, I’ve tried to join some clubs but nothing really seems to stick. I go months without really having any human interaction where I feel someone takes an interest in me. I haven’t had a girlfriend in forever, but really at this point it’s not having any friends at all that’s hitting the hardest. 

On top of all this I’ve come to realize I just don’t like my major. I’m in my school’s computer science department. I enrolled my freshman year for the money out of college thinking that since I enjoyed video games I’d enjoy this, which hasn’t been the case. If I wasn’t so far into my schooling I’d switch majors, but like I said, I’m three years in and I simply can’t afford to do that at this point so I’ll be graduating with a comp sci degree. 

I guess I just want to know if things get better after college. People tell me these are the greatest years of my life, yet I have been more miserable than ever before. I feel like I’m missing out on the college experience and my life will just be gloomy for the next 60 years like it has been these past three. Im not suicidal or anything, I’ll get through this and graduate, I just have to know there’s something afterwards to look forward to.",1680143337.0

958,The bubble has finally burst and it's devastating,10,125noxx,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/125noxx/the_bubble_has_finally_burst_and_its_devastating/,0,"Well a little backstory: I used to have clinical depression back in 2019, when I was 17 years old. This was a phase where I was put on anti depressants for about 3-4 months as far as I remember. It was a time when I developed insomnia and severe anxiety attacks.

The pandemic lockdown days were relatively calm and surprisingly positive: I seemed to forget about all the negatives I had encountered in the past.

By November 2021, I got into a good college, got nice grades, made friends and got into a relationship. Well my relationship ended last year in April 2022 and since then I have lost a lot of friends and my grades have dropped too. 

It took me some time in the subsequent months to get past the crippling anxiety and loneliness I had encountered for the first three months following my breakup by myself. I couldn't tell anyone, not my friends not my family about how depressed I really was. I had to fake it to my peers because everyone made fun of me. Somehow, I got out of the rut and actually started socialising and make new friends.

However, for the past month, it seems like my depression has caught up to me again. I feel lethargic to do anything, degrade my own self worth through negative self talk, refrain from talking with the friends I made thinking I am not worth their time and just feel like that I am not worth improving and my life is insignificant. Keep in mind that I have come to another city for my college and I live alone. 

I don't know why I am getting so anxious again, maybe it is because of my coming final exams or because I had set a certain ideal standard on my self- like my perfect ideal self- and with every passing day I feel like I am too trash to even achieve 1% of what I want too and this is making me feel so unmotivated and nervous that I cannot even speak without stuttering a line. I get rushed up just having a conversation and I feel like doing nothing but sleep as an escape.  

Also seeing my classmates do much better than me in academics is making me lose my competitive edge and leading me to spiral down into an ever increasing, perpetual state of self loathing.

Seeing what happened to me in 2019 and then in 2022 makes me feel like I do not deserve happiness. It makes me feel like a failure for not even being able to take hold of my emotions and a burden of a son for my parents, although they love me dearly. But the people that left my life, be it exes or old friends have given me such staggering trust issues which I had once forgotten but is now coming back to me. I feel like I do not respect myself anymore.

Please give me some advice... Any advice will be welcome as of now.

And yes, I cannot get therapy as my college does not follow the anonymity policy and they are definitely gonna tell my parents, and I do not wish to make them tense again, especially after 2019.

TLDR: I feel like the bubble of happiness I lived in has burst again, for the third time in the past 4 years, leaving me yet again with crippling anxiety and coveted depression.",1680095466.0
