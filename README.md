Highlighting the possibility of using state-of-the-art(SOTA) Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques in social causes such as forming mental health prognosis of people on social media
Devising a simple pipeline to parse and detect early signs of depression in people by analyzing their activities on various free speech platforms and visualizing the model learnings.
Analysis of the various SOTA transformer models and examining their accuracy in assisting in depression detection, to gain medical trustability in AI-powered technology.

#### Abstract:
Depression is a common mental illness that involves sadness and a lack of interest in all day-to-day activities. Detecting depression is important since it has to be observed and treated at an early stage to avoid severe consequences. The rise of social media as one of humanity’s most crucial public communication platforms presents a potential prospect for early identification and management of mental illness.

Depression affects at least a major percentage of adults critically. Given the pandemic’s social distancing regulations across the world, social media has become the primary mode of communication for most people. This has isolated millions suffering from mental illnesses who have increasingly turned to online platforms to express themselves and to look for guidance in dealing with their illnesses. We intend to automatically classify whether these social media posts show signs of depression or not. It is necessary to measure the level of depression from the social media texts of a being, to treat them and avoid the fatal consequences. Detecting levels of depression is challenging since it involves the mindset of the people which can change periodically. Reddit, as a platform, possesses a significant amount of textual data and it tries to maintain the ‘free speech’ idea. Using automation-enhanced scrapping, we intend to scrap textual information from such platforms, as Reddit and Twitter. We propose to train the transformer models on pre-existing data and use it for detecting depression in the scrapped data. Further, we aspire to explain the predictions using explainable AI techniques.
